Overlooked discrepancies in protocols undermine coastal restoration practices in China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-01995-x,2025-01-09,To improve the success of expanding ecosystem restoration efforts, technical guiding-standards are being developed in many nations. Whether these protocols have been well adopted to guide restoration practices remains unknown, especially in developing countries where policies evolve rapidly to balance socioeconomic development with ecosystem restoration. By conducting text semantic mining analyses, we reveal widespread discrepancies between China’s coastal restoration practices and protocols over the past four decades. Over 60% of executed restoration projects had no detailed technical standards to guide implementation, especially for severely degraded ecosystems. Development of these standards lagged significantly behind project implementation, was poorly enforced, and focused more on monitoring than guiding good restoration designs and adaptive management, likely undermining restoration performance. Nevertheless, current policies toward prioritizing ecosystem restoration offer opportunities to remedy this issue. Enforcing policies to ensure that practices are guided by protocols is necessary to promote coastal restoration success in China and globally as nations strive to achieve ambitious restoration targets.

Hydroclimate volatility on a warming Earth,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-024-00624-z,2025-01-09,Hydroclimate volatility refers to sudden, large and/or frequent transitions between very dry and very wet conditions. In this Review, we examine how hydroclimate volatility is anticipated to evolve with anthropogenic warming. Using a metric of ‘hydroclimate whiplash’ based on the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, global-averaged subseasonal (3-month) and interannual (12-month) whiplash have increased by 31–66% and 8–31%, respectively, since the mid-twentieth century. Further increases are anticipated with ongoing warming, including subseasonal increases of 113% and interannual increases of 52% over land areas with 3 °C of warming; these changes are largest at high latitudes and from northern Africa eastward into South Asia. Extensive evidence links these increases primarily to thermodynamics, namely the rising water-vapour-holding capacity and potential evaporative demand of the atmosphere. Increases in hydroclimate volatility will amplify hazards associated with rapid swings between wet and dry states (including flash floods, wildfires, landslides and disease outbreaks), and could accelerate a water management shift towards co-management of drought and flood risks. A clearer understanding of plausible future trajectories of hydroclimate volatility requires expanded focus on the response of atmospheric circulation to regional and global forcings, as well as land–ocean–atmosphere feedbacks, using large ensemble climate model simulations, storm-resolving high-resolution models and emerging machine learning methods.

Decoupling of surface water storage from precipitation in global drylands due to anthropogenic activity,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00367-7,2025-01-10,The availability of surface water in global drylands is essential for both human society and ecosystems. However, the long-term drivers of change in surface water storage, particularly those related to anthropogenic activities, remain unclear. Here we use multi-mission remote sensing data to construct monthly time series of water storage changes from 1985 to 2020 for 105,400 lakes and reservoirs in global drylands. An increase of 2.20 km<sup>3</sup> per year in surface water storage is found primarily due to the construction of new reservoirs. For lakes and old reservoirs (constructed before 1983), conversely, the trend in storage is minor when aggregated globally, but they dominate surface water storage trends in 91% of individual global dryland basins. Further analysis reveals that long-term storage changes in these water bodies are primarily linked to anthropogenic factors—including human-induced warming and water-management practices—rather than to precipitation changes, as previously thought. These findings reveal a decoupling of surface water storage from precipitation in global drylands, raising concerns about societal and ecosystem sustainability.

A new look at Earth’s water and energy with SWOT,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00372-w,2025-01-13,As the planet transitions to a new climate, adapting to the Earth’s changing water cycle remains among the top challenges faced by humanity. The relative stability of climate and water resources over the past millennia allowed humans to build complex societies with established agriculture, infrastructure and economies that today sustain the livelihood of eight billion people. As the planet warms, this steady state of water movement is being altered, and both oceanic and terrestrial components of the global water cycle are undergoing measurable changes that will probably continue. Predicting the new trajectory of Earth’s water in a warming climate begins with observing the entire water supply–demand chain across the planet, from Earth’s largest water reservoir, the ocean, to water storage, use and recycling on land. A recently launched space observatory, called the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT), is making a timely entrance and addition to the water-observing networks, by providing direct, high-resolution measurements of the water height and volume of nearly all water on the Earth’s surface. Here we link technological advances in wide-swath satellite altimetry and SWOT’s novel measurements of water volume across the planet to scientific innovations for Earth’s water cycle, including studies of changes in the water storage and dynamics in global lakes and rivers, rising seas, ocean energetics and land–ocean exchange, with implications for practical information for water resource managers and climate resilience efforts. We also discuss how SWOT innovations set the stage for future missions and integrated Earth-system approaches within the water science community.

Episodic warm climates on early Mars primed by crustal hydration,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01626-8,2025-01-15,Geological records indicate that the surface of ancient Mars harboured substantial volumes of liquid water, a resource gradually diminished by processes such as the chemical alteration of crustal materials by hydration and atmospheric escape. However, how a relatively warm climate existed on early Mars to support liquid water under a fainter young Sun is debated. Greenhouse gases such as H<sub>2</sub> in a CO<sub>2</sub>-rich atmosphere could have contributed to warming through collision-induced absorption, but whether sufficient H<sub>2</sub> was available to sustain warming remains unclear. Here we use a combined climate and photochemical model to simulate how atmospheric chemistry on early Mars responded to water–rock reactions and climate variations, as constrained by existing observations. We find that H<sub>2</sub> outgassing from crustal hydration and oxidation, supplemented by transient volcanic activity, could have generated sufficient H<sub>2</sub> fluxes to transiently foster warm, humid climates. We estimate that Mars experienced episodic warm periods of an integrated duration of ~40 million years, with each event lasting ≥10<sup>5</sup> years, consistent with the formation timescale of valley networks. Declining atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> via surface oxidant sinks or variations in the planet’s axial tilt could have led to abrupt shifts in the planet’s redox state and transition to a CO-dominated atmosphere and cold climate.

Hydroclimatic extremes threaten groundwater quality and stability,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-55890-2,2025-01-16,Heavy precipitation, drought, and other hydroclimatic extremes occur more frequently than in the past climate reference period (1961–1990). Given their strong effect on groundwater recharge dynamics, these phenomena increase the vulnerability of groundwater quantity and quality. Over the course of the past decade, we have documented changes in the composition of dissolved organic matter in groundwater. We show that fractions of ingressing surface-derived organic molecules increased significantly as groundwater levels declined, whereas concentrations of dissolved organic carbon remained constant. Molecular composition changeover was accelerated following 2018’s extreme summer drought. These findings demonstrate that hydroclimatic extremes promote rapid transport between surface ecosystems and groundwaters, thereby enabling xenobiotic substances to evade microbial processing, accrue in greater abundance in groundwater, and potentially compromise the safe nature of these potable water sources. Groundwater quality is far more vulnerable to the impact of recent climate anomalies than is currently recognized, and the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter can be used as a comprehensive indicator for groundwater quality deterioration.

Accounting for differences between crops and regions reduces estimates of nitrate leaching from nitrogen-fertilized soils,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02001-0,2025-01-16,Nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>) leaching from nitrogen (N) fertilized soils is a significant global concern, affecting both the environment and public health. However, substantial uncertainties and variabilities in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leaching factors (LFs) among regions or crops impede accurate assessments of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leaching. Here we synthesize 2500 field observations worldwide and show that LFs vary by an order of magnitude across regions and crops, primarily driven by hydroclimatic and edaphic conditions rather than N fertilizer management. Global cropland NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leaching from synthetic N fertilization, calculated through spatially explicit (15.4, 14.8–16.1 Tg N yr<sup>–1</sup>) and crop-specific (12.9, 11.0–14.8 Tg N yr<sup>–1</sup>) LFs, is 41% lower than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Tier 1 global inventory. Over 47% of this leaching is concentrated in China, India, and the United States, with maize, wheat, rice and vegetables accounting for nearly half of it. Improved regional and crop-specific LFs will provide a benchmark for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leaching abatement by pinpointing potential global hotspots.

Gross primary productivity is more sensitive to accelerated flash droughts,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02013-w,2025-01-17,Flash droughts, characterized by their rapid onset, substantially affect terrestrial ecosystems. However, the sensitivity of ecosystem productivity to the rapid development of flash droughts under varying vegetation conditions remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the ecosystem response to the speed of flash drought onset for different plant functional types, considering the decline rate of root-zone soil moisture and standardized gross primary productivity anomaly. Our findings reveal a significant increase of approximately 10% in the proportion of 1- and 2-pentad (5 and 10 days) onset flash droughts leading to negative standardized gross primary productivity anomalies during 2001–2018. Furthermore, while standardized gross primary productivity anomalies decline at higher rates, they do not promptly respond on a shorter timescale to faster-onset flash droughts compared to slower-onset flash droughts. Vegetation types with shallower root systems exhibit higher sensitivities to faster-onset flash droughts, suggesting an escalating threat to terrestrial ecosystems in a changing climate.

Counteracting greenhouse gas and aerosol influences intensify global water seasonality over the past century,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02025-6,2025-01-18,Variations in water availability seasonality significantly impact society and ecosystems. While many studies have focused on mean or extreme precipitation, the response of water availability seasonality, influencing yearly water distribution beyond individual extremes, to human-induced climate change remains underexplored. Here we examine global and regional water availability seasonality changes from 1915 to 2014, quantifying how anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols have influenced these variations using reanalysis and simulations from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. Despite large spatiotemporal uncertainties due to regional variability and model assumptions, we find that greenhouse gases significantly amplify the seasonality, while aerosols reduce it. Given that the positive effects of greenhouse gases surpass the aerosols’ negative effects, the counterbalancing influences have led to an overall enhancement in seasonality of water availability over the past century. This trend is expected to continue in the future as greenhouse gases-induced warming continues to rise and aerosol levels decline.

The first geospatial dataset of irrigated fields (2020–2024) in Vojvodina (Serbia),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04443-9,2025-01-18,Irrigation is a cornerstone of global food security, enabling sustainable agricultural production and helping to ensure that food is available for people around the world, now and in the future. Mapping irrigated fields provides valuable information for sustainable water management, agricultural development, and environmental conservation efforts. However, the collection of high-quality training data, which is necessary for accurate irrigation mapping remains costly and labour-intensive. To address this, we created a georeferenced regional dataset consisting of location, crop type, and occurrence of the irrigation equipment which are essential information for mapping irrigated fields. Four main irrigated crops were considered: maize, soybean, sugar beet, and wheat. The dataset, consisting of a total of 1256 parcels, is created for Vojvodina, the main agricultural area in Serbia, spanning the period of five years (2020–2024). This study’s goal is to give accessibility to our dataset which further can be explored and used for building or fine-tuning machine learning and deep learning models for the automatic detection of irrigated fields using satellite imagery.

Gross primary productivity is more sensitive to accelerated flash droughts,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02013-w,2025-01-17,Flash droughts, characterized by their rapid onset, substantially affect terrestrial ecosystems. However, the sensitivity of ecosystem productivity to the rapid development of flash droughts under varying vegetation conditions remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the ecosystem response to the speed of flash drought onset for different plant functional types, considering the decline rate of root-zone soil moisture and standardized gross primary productivity anomaly. Our findings reveal a significant increase of approximately 10% in the proportion of 1- and 2-pentad (5 and 10 days) onset flash droughts leading to negative standardized gross primary productivity anomalies during 2001–2018. Furthermore, while standardized gross primary productivity anomalies decline at higher rates, they do not promptly respond on a shorter timescale to faster-onset flash droughts compared to slower-onset flash droughts. Vegetation types with shallower root systems exhibit higher sensitivities to faster-onset flash droughts, suggesting an escalating threat to terrestrial ecosystems in a changing climate.

Counteracting greenhouse gas and aerosol influences intensify global water seasonality over the past century,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02025-6,2025-01-18,Variations in water availability seasonality significantly impact society and ecosystems. While many studies have focused on mean or extreme precipitation, the response of water availability seasonality, influencing yearly water distribution beyond individual extremes, to human-induced climate change remains underexplored. Here we examine global and regional water availability seasonality changes from 1915 to 2014, quantifying how anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols have influenced these variations using reanalysis and simulations from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. Despite large spatiotemporal uncertainties due to regional variability and model assumptions, we find that greenhouse gases significantly amplify the seasonality, while aerosols reduce it. Given that the positive effects of greenhouse gases surpass the aerosols’ negative effects, the counterbalancing influences have led to an overall enhancement in seasonality of water availability over the past century. This trend is expected to continue in the future as greenhouse gases-induced warming continues to rise and aerosol levels decline.

The first geospatial dataset of irrigated fields (2020–2024) in Vojvodina (Serbia),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04443-9,2025-01-18,Irrigation is a cornerstone of global food security, enabling sustainable agricultural production and helping to ensure that food is available for people around the world, now and in the future. Mapping irrigated fields provides valuable information for sustainable water management, agricultural development, and environmental conservation efforts. However, the collection of high-quality training data, which is necessary for accurate irrigation mapping remains costly and labour-intensive. To address this, we created a georeferenced regional dataset consisting of location, crop type, and occurrence of the irrigation equipment which are essential information for mapping irrigated fields. Four main irrigated crops were considered: maize, soybean, sugar beet, and wheat. The dataset, consisting of a total of 1256 parcels, is created for Vojvodina, the main agricultural area in Serbia, spanning the period of five years (2020–2024). This study’s goal is to give accessibility to our dataset which further can be explored and used for building or fine-tuning machine learning and deep learning models for the automatic detection of irrigated fields using satellite imagery.

Flood modeling prior to the instrumental era reveals limited magnitude of 1931 Yangtze flood,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00908-1,2025-01-19,The global flood risk urges an improved understanding of flood magnitude and its mechanism, which needs insights from pre-instrumental flood investigations. Due to data scarcity, reconstructing pre-instrumental flood magnitudes relies on statistical downscaling, failing to capture nonlinear and dynamic characteristics. We developed a dynamical approach, NorESM-WRF-SWAT, integrating a global climate, a regional, and a hydrologic model to investigate the 1931 Yangtze River flood (the deadliest in the world) and compared it with the 1998’s. Through validation, our method outperforms the statistical method in simulating precipitations and river discharges. For the first time, we presented detailed insights into the intensity and duration of the 1931 flood, revealing a smaller magnitude but associated with an amplified loss, likely due to social vulnerability and reduced societal resilience compared to the 1998’s. While successful simulation can be interfered with by model variability, our dynamical method shows promise for simulating pre-instrumental flood and building a long-term pre-instrumental-hydrology database.

Hydroclimate volatility on a warming Earth,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-024-00624-z,2025-01-09,Hydroclimate volatility refers to sudden, large and/or frequent transitions between very dry and very wet conditions. In this Review, we examine how hydroclimate volatility is anticipated to evolve with anthropogenic warming. Using a metric of ‘hydroclimate whiplash’ based on the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, global-averaged subseasonal (3-month) and interannual (12-month) whiplash have increased by 31–66% and 8–31%, respectively, since the mid-twentieth century. Further increases are anticipated with ongoing warming, including subseasonal increases of 113% and interannual increases of 52% over land areas with 3 °C of warming; these changes are largest at high latitudes and from northern Africa eastward into South Asia. Extensive evidence links these increases primarily to thermodynamics, namely the rising water-vapour-holding capacity and potential evaporative demand of the atmosphere. Increases in hydroclimate volatility will amplify hazards associated with rapid swings between wet and dry states (including flash floods, wildfires, landslides and disease outbreaks), and could accelerate a water management shift towards co-management of drought and flood risks. A clearer understanding of plausible future trajectories of hydroclimate volatility requires expanded focus on the response of atmospheric circulation to regional and global forcings, as well as land–ocean–atmosphere feedbacks, using large ensemble climate model simulations, storm-resolving high-resolution models and emerging machine learning methods.

Decoupling of surface water storage from precipitation in global drylands due to anthropogenic activity,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00367-7,2025-01-10,The availability of surface water in global drylands is essential for both human society and ecosystems. However, the long-term drivers of change in surface water storage, particularly those related to anthropogenic activities, remain unclear. Here we use multi-mission remote sensing data to construct monthly time series of water storage changes from 1985 to 2020 for 105,400 lakes and reservoirs in global drylands. An increase of 2.20 km<sup>3</sup> per year in surface water storage is found primarily due to the construction of new reservoirs. For lakes and old reservoirs (constructed before 1983), conversely, the trend in storage is minor when aggregated globally, but they dominate surface water storage trends in 91% of individual global dryland basins. Further analysis reveals that long-term storage changes in these water bodies are primarily linked to anthropogenic factors—including human-induced warming and water-management practices—rather than to precipitation changes, as previously thought. These findings reveal a decoupling of surface water storage from precipitation in global drylands, raising concerns about societal and ecosystem sustainability.

A new look at Earth’s water and energy with SWOT,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00372-w,2025-01-13,As the planet transitions to a new climate, adapting to the Earth’s changing water cycle remains among the top challenges faced by humanity. The relative stability of climate and water resources over the past millennia allowed humans to build complex societies with established agriculture, infrastructure and economies that today sustain the livelihood of eight billion people. As the planet warms, this steady state of water movement is being altered, and both oceanic and terrestrial components of the global water cycle are undergoing measurable changes that will probably continue. Predicting the new trajectory of Earth’s water in a warming climate begins with observing the entire water supply–demand chain across the planet, from Earth’s largest water reservoir, the ocean, to water storage, use and recycling on land. A recently launched space observatory, called the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT), is making a timely entrance and addition to the water-observing networks, by providing direct, high-resolution measurements of the water height and volume of nearly all water on the Earth’s surface. Here we link technological advances in wide-swath satellite altimetry and SWOT’s novel measurements of water volume across the planet to scientific innovations for Earth’s water cycle, including studies of changes in the water storage and dynamics in global lakes and rivers, rising seas, ocean energetics and land–ocean exchange, with implications for practical information for water resource managers and climate resilience efforts. We also discuss how SWOT innovations set the stage for future missions and integrated Earth-system approaches within the water science community.

Episodic warm climates on early Mars primed by crustal hydration,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01626-8,2025-01-15,Geological records indicate that the surface of ancient Mars harboured substantial volumes of liquid water, a resource gradually diminished by processes such as the chemical alteration of crustal materials by hydration and atmospheric escape. However, how a relatively warm climate existed on early Mars to support liquid water under a fainter young Sun is debated. Greenhouse gases such as H<sub>2</sub> in a CO<sub>2</sub>-rich atmosphere could have contributed to warming through collision-induced absorption, but whether sufficient H<sub>2</sub> was available to sustain warming remains unclear. Here we use a combined climate and photochemical model to simulate how atmospheric chemistry on early Mars responded to water–rock reactions and climate variations, as constrained by existing observations. We find that H<sub>2</sub> outgassing from crustal hydration and oxidation, supplemented by transient volcanic activity, could have generated sufficient H<sub>2</sub> fluxes to transiently foster warm, humid climates. We estimate that Mars experienced episodic warm periods of an integrated duration of ~40 million years, with each event lasting ≥10<sup>5</sup> years, consistent with the formation timescale of valley networks. Declining atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> via surface oxidant sinks or variations in the planet’s axial tilt could have led to abrupt shifts in the planet’s redox state and transition to a CO-dominated atmosphere and cold climate.

Hydroclimatic extremes threaten groundwater quality and stability,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-55890-2,2025-01-16,Heavy precipitation, drought, and other hydroclimatic extremes occur more frequently than in the past climate reference period (1961–1990). Given their strong effect on groundwater recharge dynamics, these phenomena increase the vulnerability of groundwater quantity and quality. Over the course of the past decade, we have documented changes in the composition of dissolved organic matter in groundwater. We show that fractions of ingressing surface-derived organic molecules increased significantly as groundwater levels declined, whereas concentrations of dissolved organic carbon remained constant. Molecular composition changeover was accelerated following 2018’s extreme summer drought. These findings demonstrate that hydroclimatic extremes promote rapid transport between surface ecosystems and groundwaters, thereby enabling xenobiotic substances to evade microbial processing, accrue in greater abundance in groundwater, and potentially compromise the safe nature of these potable water sources. Groundwater quality is far more vulnerable to the impact of recent climate anomalies than is currently recognized, and the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter can be used as a comprehensive indicator for groundwater quality deterioration.

Accounting for differences between crops and regions reduces estimates of nitrate leaching from nitrogen-fertilized soils,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02001-0,2025-01-16,Nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>) leaching from nitrogen (N) fertilized soils is a significant global concern, affecting both the environment and public health. However, substantial uncertainties and variabilities in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leaching factors (LFs) among regions or crops impede accurate assessments of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leaching. Here we synthesize 2500 field observations worldwide and show that LFs vary by an order of magnitude across regions and crops, primarily driven by hydroclimatic and edaphic conditions rather than N fertilizer management. Global cropland NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leaching from synthetic N fertilization, calculated through spatially explicit (15.4, 14.8–16.1 Tg N yr<sup>–1</sup>) and crop-specific (12.9, 11.0–14.8 Tg N yr<sup>–1</sup>) LFs, is 41% lower than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Tier 1 global inventory.

Improved regional and crop-specific LFs will provide a benchmark for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leaching abatement by pinpointing potential global hotspots.

Emergent constraints on global soil moisture projections under climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02024-7,2025-01-20,Surface soil moisture is projected to decrease under global warming. Such projections are mostly based on climate models, which show large uncertainty (i.e., inter-model spread) partly due to inadequate observational constraint. Here we identify strong physically-based emergent relationships between soil moisture change (2070–2099 minus 1980–2014) and recent air temperature and precipitation trends across an ensemble of climate models. We extend the commonly used univariate Emergent Constraints to a bivariate method and use observed temperature and precipitation trends to constrain global soil moisture changes. Our results show that the bivariate emergent constraints can reduce soil moisture change uncertainty by 7.87%, which is four times more effective than traditional temperature-based univariate constraints. The bivariate emergent constraints change the sign of soil moisture change from negative to positive for semi-arid, dry sub-humid and humid regions and global land as a whole, but exacerbates the drying trend in arid and hyper-arid regions.

Increasing certainty in projected local extreme precipitation change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56235-9,2025-01-20,The latest climate models project widely varying magnitudes of future extreme precipitation changes, thus impeding effective adaptation planning. Many observational constraints have been proposed to reduce the uncertainty of these projections at global to sub-continental scales, but adaptation generally requires detailed, local scale information. Here, we present a temperature-based adaptative emergent constraint strategy combined with data aggregation that reduces the error variance of projected end-of-century changes in annual extremes of daily precipitation under a high emissions scenario by &gt;20% across most areas of the world. These improved projections could benefit nearly 90% of the world’s population by permitting better impact assessment and adaptation planning at local levels. Our physically motivated strategy, which considers the thermodynamic and dynamic components of projected extreme precipitation change, exploits the link between global warming and the thermodynamic component of extreme precipitation. Rigorous cross-validation provides strong evidence of its reliability in constraining local extreme precipitation projections.

Dichotomy retreat and aqueous alteration on Noachian Mars recorded in highland remnants,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01634-8,2025-01-20,The Mawrth Vallis region is a plateau situated on the highland side of Mars’ hemispheric dichotomy boundary. It has a &gt;200-m-thick phyllosilicate-bearing stratigraphic succession that indicates extensive aqueous alteration between 4.1 Ga and 3.7 Ga, during the Noachian Period. In addition, thousands of kilometre-scale isolated mounds in the lowlands north and west of Mawrth Vallis have been identified. Here we use geomorphological and spectroscopic analyses to show that the mounds are erosional remnants that formed through retreat of the highland plateau in the Noachian. Consequently, the escarpment that marks the surface expression of the dichotomy must have receded south-southeast by hundreds of kilometres in this area. Lateral and stratigraphic geochemical variation in the mounds show that widespread, multiphase aqueous alteration occurred in situ across this region in surface and subsurface environments. The mound succession is underlain by a pyroxene-rich unit that represents unaltered material below the regional phyllosilicate-bearing sequence and is unconformably overlain by a thin capping unit that marks the end of large-scale regional aqueous activity. Thus, the mounds contain a stratigraphic record of the onset, evolution and cessation of Noachian aqueous conditions in this region, detailing the environment and climate of Mars at its most habitable.

Projected runoff declines from plant physiological effects on precipitation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00361-z,2025-01-20,The impact of plants on runoff under high atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is a major uncertainty for future water resources. Theory and Earth system models (ESMs) suggest that stricter plant stomatal regulation under high CO<sub>2</sub> will reduce transpiration, potentially boosting runoff. Yet, across a 12-member ensemble of idealized ESM simulations that isolate plant responses to CO<sub>2</sub>, we show that lower transpiration robustly enhances runoff over only 5% of modelled global land area. Precipitation changes are five times more important than transpiration changes in driving runoff responses and are a significant signal of CO<sub>2</sub> physiological forcing over 31–57% of land areas across models. Crucially, ESMs largely disagree on where physiologically forced precipitation changes occur but agree that plant responses in most locations are as likely to reduce runoff as increase it. These results imply that large model uncertainties in precipitation responses, rather than transpiration responses, explain why ESMs disagree on plant physiologically driven runoff changes.

Measurements of groundwater, hydrodynamics, and sand characteristics at a dissipative sea turtle nesting beach,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04455-5,2025-01-21,Beach groundwater and nearshore hydrodynamic data were collected during a field experiment along two dissipative beach transects on Galveston Island, Texas, in the fall of 2023. The monitored beaches serve as nesting habitat for the critically endangered Kemp’s ridley sea turtle. Conditions ranged from calm to stormy, with two storms occurring during the experiment, inundating the entire beach up to the dune toe. Collected hydrodynamic data include readings from pressure loggers submerged in the foreshore and mounted in groundwater wells in the backshore, data from two wave buoys about 1.5 km offshore, and GoPro timestacks of the instantaneous waterline (wave runup). Other collected data include bathymetry and topography surveys, subsurface temperature and moisture content readings, and sediment characteristics. This comprehensive dataset can be used to (1) study relevant beach inundation and groundwater processes, including their effect on the local ecosystem (e.g., repeated flooding of sea turtle nests), (2) study the propagation of nearshore hydrodynamic processes into the beach matrix and groundwater table, and (3) validate existing beach groundwater models.

GEM-Hydro achieves satisfactory simulations of various hydrologic variables when compared to reference datasets. This dataset can be used for example to drive any routing model, compute climatologies or statistics for different hydrologic variables and study their variability as a function of the local geo-morphology, etc.

Flood modeling prior to the instrumental era reveals limited magnitude of 1931 Yangtze flood,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00908-1,2025-01-19,The global flood risk urges an improved understanding of flood magnitude and its mechanism, which needs insights from pre-instrumental flood investigations. Due to data scarcity, reconstructing pre-instrumental flood magnitudes relies on statistical downscaling, failing to capture nonlinear and dynamic characteristics. We developed a dynamical approach, NorESM-WRF-SWAT, integrating a global climate, a regional, and a hydrologic model to investigate the 1931 Yangtze River flood (the deadliest in the world) and compared it with the 1998’s. Through validation, our method outperforms the statistical method in simulating precipitations and river discharges. For the first time, we presented detailed insights into the intensity and duration of the 1931 flood, revealing a smaller magnitude but associated with an amplified loss, likely due to social vulnerability and reduced societal resilience compared to the 1998’s. While successful simulation can be interfered with by model variability, our dynamical method shows promise for simulating pre-instrumental flood and building a long-term pre-instrumental-hydrology database.

Emergent constraints on global soil moisture projections under climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02024-7,2025-01-20,Surface soil moisture is projected to decrease under global warming. Such projections are mostly based on climate models, which show large uncertainty (i.e., inter-model spread) partly due to inadequate observational constraint. Here we identify strong physically-based emergent relationships between soil moisture change (2070–2099 minus 1980–2014) and recent air temperature and precipitation trends across an ensemble of climate models. We extend the commonly used univariate Emergent Constraints to a bivariate method and use observed temperature and precipitation trends to constrain global soil moisture changes. Our results show that the bivariate emergent constraints can reduce soil moisture change uncertainty by 7.87%, which is four times more effective than traditional temperature-based univariate constraints. The bivariate emergent constraints change the sign of soil moisture change from negative to positive for semi-arid, dry sub-humid and humid regions and global land as a whole, but exacerbates the drying trend in arid and hyper-arid regions.

Increasing certainty in projected local extreme precipitation change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56235-9,2025-01-20,The latest climate models project widely varying magnitudes of future extreme precipitation changes, thus impeding effective adaptation planning. Many observational constraints have been proposed to reduce the uncertainty of these projections at global to sub-continental scales, but adaptation generally requires detailed, local scale information. Here, we present a temperature-based adaptative emergent constraint strategy combined with data aggregation that reduces the error variance of projected end-of-century changes in annual extremes of daily precipitation under a high emissions scenario by &gt;20% across most areas of the world. These improved projections could benefit nearly 90% of the world’s population by permitting better impact assessment and adaptation planning at local levels. Our physically motivated strategy, which considers the thermodynamic and dynamic components of projected extreme precipitation change, exploits the link between global warming and the thermodynamic component of extreme precipitation. Rigorous cross-validation provides strong evidence of its reliability in constraining local extreme precipitation projections.

Dichotomy retreat and aqueous alteration on Noachian Mars recorded in highland remnants,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01634-8,2025-01-20,The Mawrth Vallis region is a plateau situated on the highland side of Mars’ hemispheric dichotomy boundary. It has a &gt;200-m-thick phyllosilicate-bearing stratigraphic succession that indicates extensive aqueous alteration between 4.1 Ga and 3.7 Ga, during the Noachian Period. In addition, thousands of kilometre-scale isolated mounds in the lowlands north and west of Mawrth Vallis have been identified. Here we use geomorphological and spectroscopic analyses to show that the mounds are erosional remnants that formed through retreat of the highland plateau in the Noachian. Consequently, the escarpment that marks the surface expression of the dichotomy must have receded south-southeast by hundreds of kilometres in this area. Lateral and stratigraphic geochemical variation in the mounds show that widespread, multiphase aqueous alteration occurred in situ across this region in surface and subsurface environments. The mound succession is underlain by a pyroxene-rich unit that represents unaltered material below the regional phyllosilicate-bearing sequence and is unconformably overlain by a thin capping unit that marks the end of large-scale regional aqueous activity. Thus, the mounds contain a stratigraphic record of the onset, evolution and cessation of Noachian aqueous conditions in this region, detailing the environment and climate of Mars at its most habitable.

Projected runoff declines from plant physiological effects on precipitation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00361-z,2025-01-20,The impact of plants on runoff under high atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is a major uncertainty for future water resources. Theory and Earth system models (ESMs) suggest that stricter plant stomatal regulation under high CO<sub>2</sub> will reduce transpiration, potentially boosting runoff. Yet, across a 12-member ensemble of idealized ESM simulations that isolate plant responses to CO<sub>2</sub>, we show that lower transpiration robustly enhances runoff over only 5% of modelled global land area. Precipitation changes are five times more important than transpiration changes in driving runoff responses and are a significant signal of CO<sub>2</sub> physiological forcing over 31–57% of land areas across models. Crucially, ESMs largely disagree on where physiologically forced precipitation changes occur but agree that plant responses in most locations are as likely to reduce runoff as increase it. These results imply that large model uncertainties in precipitation responses, rather than transpiration responses, explain why ESMs disagree on plant physiologically driven runoff changes.

Measurements of groundwater, hydrodynamics, and sand characteristics at a dissipative sea turtle nesting beach,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04455-5,2025-01-21,Beach groundwater and nearshore hydrodynamic data were collected during a field experiment along two dissipative beach transects on Galveston Island, Texas, in the fall of 2023. The monitored beaches serve as nesting habitat for the critically endangered Kemp’s ridley sea turtle. Conditions ranged from calm to stormy, with two storms occurring during the experiment, inundating the entire beach up to the dune toe. Collected hydrodynamic data include readings from pressure loggers submerged in the foreshore and mounted in groundwater wells in the backshore, data from two wave buoys about 1.5 km offshore, and GoPro timestacks of the instantaneous waterline (wave runup). Other collected data include bathymetry and topography surveys, subsurface temperature and moisture content readings, and sediment characteristics. This comprehensive dataset can be used to (1) study relevant beach inundation and groundwater processes, including their effect on the local ecosystem (e.g., repeated flooding of sea turtle nests), (2) study the propagation of nearshore hydrodynamic processes into the beach matrix and groundwater table, and (3) validate existing beach groundwater models.

The dataset covers the basins of the Laurentian Great Lakes and the Ottawa River and extends over the period 2001–2018. The data consist of all variables (hourly fluxes and state variables) related to the water balance of GEM-Hydro’s land-surface scheme (including precipitation, surface and sub-surface runoff, drainage, evaporation, snow water equivalent, soil moisture…) and mean daily streamflow at 212 gauge locations. These outputs were simulated with a calibrated version of the GEM-Hydro model that was run in open-loop mode (no assimilation) and driven with atmospheric forcings coming from ECCC’s Canadian Surface Reanalysis version 2.1. GEM-Hydro achieves satisfactory simulations of various hydrologic variables when compared to reference datasets. This dataset can be used for example to drive any routing model, compute climatologies or statistics for different hydrologic variables and study their variability as a function of the local geo-morphology, etc.

Gross primary productivity is more sensitive to accelerated flash droughts,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02013-w,2025-01-17,Flash droughts, characterized by their rapid onset, substantially affect terrestrial ecosystems. However, the sensitivity of ecosystem productivity to the rapid development of flash droughts under varying vegetation conditions remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the ecosystem response to the speed of flash drought onset for different plant functional types, considering the decline rate of root-zone soil moisture and standardized gross primary productivity anomaly. Our findings reveal a significant increase of approximately 10% in the proportion of 1- and 2-pentad (5 and 10 days) onset flash droughts leading to negative standardized gross primary productivity anomalies during 2001–2018. Furthermore, while standardized gross primary productivity anomalies decline at higher rates, they do not promptly respond on a shorter timescale to faster-onset flash droughts compared to slower-onset flash droughts. Vegetation types with shallower root systems exhibit higher sensitivities to faster-onset flash droughts, suggesting an escalating threat to terrestrial ecosystems in a changing climate.

Counteracting greenhouse gas and aerosol influences intensify global water seasonality over the past century,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02025-6,2025-01-18,Variations in water availability seasonality significantly impact society and ecosystems. While many studies have focused on mean or extreme precipitation, the response of water availability seasonality, influencing yearly water distribution beyond individual extremes, to human-induced climate change remains underexplored. Here we examine global and regional water availability seasonality changes from 1915 to 2014, quantifying how anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols have influenced these variations using reanalysis and simulations from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. Despite large spatiotemporal uncertainties due to regional variability and model assumptions, we find that greenhouse gases significantly amplify the seasonality, while aerosols reduce it. Given that the positive effects of greenhouse gases surpass the aerosols’ negative effects, the counterbalancing influences have led to an overall enhancement in seasonality of water availability over the past century. This trend is expected to continue in the future as greenhouse gases-induced warming continues to rise and aerosol levels decline.

The first geospatial dataset of irrigated fields (2020–2024) in Vojvodina (Serbia),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04443-9,2025-01-18,Irrigation is a cornerstone of global food security, enabling sustainable agricultural production and helping to ensure that food is available for people around the world, now and in the future. Mapping irrigated fields provides valuable information for sustainable water management, agricultural development, and environmental conservation efforts. However, the collection of high-quality training data, which is necessary for accurate irrigation mapping remains costly and labour-intensive. To address this, we created a georeferenced regional dataset consisting of location, crop type, and occurrence of the irrigation equipment which are essential information for mapping irrigated fields. Four main irrigated crops were considered: maize, soybean, sugar beet, and wheat. The dataset, consisting of a total of 1256 parcels, is created for Vojvodina, the main agricultural area in Serbia, spanning the period of five years (2020–2024). This study’s goal is to give accessibility to our dataset which further can be explored and used for building or fine-tuning machine learning and deep learning models for the automatic detection of irrigated fields using satellite imagery.

Multifaceted changes in water availability with a warmer climate,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00913-4,2025-01-24,Climate warming alters spatial and seasonal patterns of surface water availability (P-E), affecting runoff and terrestrial water storage. However, a comprehensive assessment of these changes across various hydroclimates remains lacking. We develop a multi-model ensemble approach to classify global terrestrial hydroclimate into four distinct regimes based on the mean and seasonality of P-E. P-E is projected to become increasingly variable across space and time. Wet regions with low and high seasonality are likely to experience more concentrated increases in wet-season runoff by up to 20%, highlighting potential increases in flood-related vulnerability. Low-seasonality regions exhibit faster wet-season increases and more rapid dry-season decreases in soil moisture, heightening the likelihood of water scarcity and drought. Conversely, dry regions with high seasonality are less sensitive to climate change. These findings underscore the multifaceted impacts of climate change on global water resources, necessitating the need for tailored adaptation strategies for different hydroclimate regimes.

The first geospatial dataset of irrigated fields (2020–2024) in Vojvodina (Serbia),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04443-9,2025-01-18,Irrigation is a cornerstone of global food security, enabling sustainable agricultural production and helping to ensure that food is available for people around the world, now and in the future. Mapping irrigated fields provides valuable information for sustainable water management, agricultural development, and environmental conservation efforts. However, the collection of high-quality training data, which is necessary for accurate irrigation mapping remains costly and labour-intensive. To address this, we created a georeferenced regional dataset consisting of location, crop type, and occurrence of the irrigation equipment which are essential information for mapping irrigated fields. Four main irrigated crops were considered: maize, soybean, sugar beet, and wheat. The dataset, consisting of a total of 1256 parcels, is created for Vojvodina, the main agricultural area in Serbia, spanning the period of five years (2020–2024). This study’s goal is to give accessibility to our dataset which further can be explored and used for building or fine-tuning machine learning and deep learning models for the automatic detection of irrigated fields using satellite imagery.

Flood modeling prior to the instrumental era reveals limited magnitude of 1931 Yangtze flood,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00908-1,2025-01-19,The global flood risk urges an improved understanding of flood magnitude and its mechanism, which needs insights from pre-instrumental flood investigations. Due to data scarcity, reconstructing pre-instrumental flood magnitudes relies on statistical downscaling, failing to capture nonlinear and dynamic characteristics. We developed a dynamical approach, NorESM-WRF-SWAT, integrating a global climate, a regional, and a hydrologic model to investigate the 1931 Yangtze River flood (the deadliest in the world) and compared it with the 1998’s. Through validation, our method outperforms the statistical method in simulating precipitations and river discharges. For the first time, we presented detailed insights into the intensity and duration of the 1931 flood, revealing a smaller magnitude but associated with an amplified loss, likely due to social vulnerability and reduced societal resilience compared to the 1998’s. While successful simulation can be interfered with by model variability, our dynamical method shows promise for simulating pre-instrumental flood and building a long-term pre-instrumental-hydrology database.

Emergent constraints on global soil moisture projections under climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02024-7,2025-01-20,Surface soil moisture is projected to decrease under global warming. Such projections are mostly based on climate models, which show large uncertainty (i.e., inter-model spread) partly due to inadequate observational constraint. Here we identify strong physically-based emergent relationships between soil moisture change (2070–2099 minus 1980–2014) and recent air temperature and precipitation trends across an ensemble of climate models. We extend the commonly used univariate Emergent Constraints to a bivariate method and use observed temperature and precipitation trends to constrain global soil moisture changes. Our results show that the bivariate emergent constraints can reduce soil moisture change uncertainty by 7.87%, which is four times more effective than traditional temperature-based univariate constraints. The bivariate emergent constraints change the sign of soil moisture change from negative to positive for semi-arid, dry sub-humid and humid regions and global land as a whole, but exacerbates the drying trend in arid and hyper-arid regions.

Increasing certainty in projected local extreme precipitation change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56235-9,2025-01-20,The latest climate models project widely varying magnitudes of future extreme precipitation changes, thus impeding effective adaptation planning. Many observational constraints have been proposed to reduce the uncertainty of these projections at global to sub-continental scales, but adaptation generally requires detailed, local scale information. Here, we present a temperature-based adaptative emergent constraint strategy combined with data aggregation that reduces the error variance of projected end-of-century changes in annual extremes of daily precipitation under a high emissions scenario by &gt;20% across most areas of the world. These improved projections could benefit nearly 90% of the world’s population by permitting better impact assessment and adaptation planning at local levels. Our physically motivated strategy, which considers the thermodynamic and dynamic components of projected extreme precipitation change, exploits the link between global warming and the thermodynamic component of extreme precipitation. Rigorous cross-validation provides strong evidence of its reliability in constraining local extreme precipitation projections.

Dichotomy retreat and aqueous alteration on Noachian Mars recorded in highland remnants,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01634-8,2025-01-20,The Mawrth Vallis region is a plateau situated on the highland side of Mars’ hemispheric dichotomy boundary. It has a &gt;200-m-thick phyllosilicate-bearing stratigraphic succession that indicates extensive aqueous alteration between 4.1 Ga and 3.7 Ga, during the Noachian Period. In addition, thousands of kilometre-scale isolated mounds in the lowlands north and west of Mawrth Vallis have been identified. Here we use geomorphological and spectroscopic analyses to show that the mounds are erosional remnants that formed through retreat of the highland plateau in the Noachian. Consequently, the escarpment that marks the surface expression of the dichotomy must have receded south-southeast by hundreds of kilometres in this area. Lateral and stratigraphic geochemical variation in the mounds show that widespread, multiphase aqueous alteration occurred in situ across this region in surface and subsurface environments. The mound succession is underlain by a pyroxene-rich unit that represents unaltered material below the regional phyllosilicate-bearing sequence and is unconformably overlain by a thin capping unit that marks the end of large-scale regional aqueous activity. Thus, the mounds contain a stratigraphic record of the onset, evolution and cessation of Noachian aqueous conditions in this region, detailing the environment and climate of Mars at its most habitable.

Projected runoff declines from plant physiological effects on precipitation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00361-z,2025-01-20,The impact of plants on runoff under high atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is a major uncertainty for future water resources. Theory and Earth system models (ESMs) suggest that stricter plant stomatal regulation under high CO<sub>2</sub> will reduce transpiration, potentially boosting runoff. Yet, across a 12-member ensemble of idealized ESM simulations that isolate plant responses to CO<sub>2</sub>, we show that lower transpiration robustly enhances runoff over only 5% of modelled global land area. Precipitation changes are five times more important than transpiration changes in driving runoff responses and are a significant signal of CO<sub>2</sub> physiological forcing over 31–57% of land areas across models. Crucially, ESMs largely disagree on where physiologically forced precipitation changes occur but agree that plant responses in most locations are as likely to reduce runoff as increase it. These results imply that large model uncertainties in precipitation responses, rather than transpiration responses, explain why ESMs disagree on plant physiologically driven runoff changes.

Measurements of groundwater, hydrodynamics, and sand characteristics at a dissipative sea turtle nesting beach,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04455-5,2025-01-21,Beach groundwater and nearshore hydrodynamic data were collected during a field experiment along two dissipative beach transects on Galveston Island, Texas, in the fall of 2023. The monitored beaches serve as nesting habitat for the critically endangered Kemp’s ridley sea turtle. Conditions ranged from calm to stormy, with two storms occurring during the experiment, inundating the entire beach up to the dune toe. Collected hydrodynamic data include readings from pressure loggers submerged in the foreshore and mounted in groundwater wells in the backshore, data from two wave buoys about 1.5 km offshore, and GoPro timestacks of the instantaneous waterline (wave runup). Other collected data include bathymetry and topography surveys, subsurface temperature and moisture content readings, and sediment characteristics. This comprehensive dataset can be used to (1) study relevant beach inundation and groundwater processes, including their effect on the local ecosystem (e.g., repeated flooding of sea turtle nests), (2) study the propagation of nearshore hydrodynamic processes into the beach matrix and groundwater table, and (3) validate existing beach groundwater models.

The dataset covers the basins of the Laurentian Great Lakes and the Ottawa River and extends over the period 2001–2018. The data consist of all variables (hourly fluxes and state variables) related to the water balance of GEM-Hydro’s land-surface scheme (including precipitation, surface and sub-surface runoff, drainage, evaporation, snow water equivalent, soil moisture…) and mean daily streamflow at 212 gauge locations. These outputs were simulated with a calibrated version of the GEM-Hydro model that was run in open-loop mode (no assimilation) and driven with atmospheric forcings coming from ECCC’s Canadian Surface Reanalysis version 2.1.

Multifaceted changes in water availability with a warmer climate,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00913-4,2025-01-24,Climate warming alters spatial and seasonal patterns of surface water availability (P-E), affecting runoff and terrestrial water storage. However, a comprehensive assessment of these changes across various hydroclimates remains lacking. We develop a multi-model ensemble approach to classify global terrestrial hydroclimate into four distinct regimes based on the mean and seasonality of P-E. P-E is projected to become increasingly variable across space and time. Wet regions with low and high seasonality are likely to experience more concentrated increases in wet-season runoff by up to 20%, highlighting potential increases in flood-related vulnerability. Low-seasonality regions exhibit faster wet-season increases and more rapid dry-season decreases in soil moisture, heightening the likelihood of water scarcity and drought. Conversely, dry regions with high seasonality are less sensitive to climate change. These findings underscore the multifaceted impacts of climate change on global water resources, necessitating the need for tailored adaptation strategies for different hydroclimate regimes.

However, temporal gaps within these datasets and the lack of TWSA observations prior to 2002 limit our understanding of long-term freshwater variability. In this study, we develop GR<i>Ai</i>CE, a set of four global monthly TWSA reconstructions from 1984 to 2021 at 0.5° spatial resolution, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) neural networks.

Shifted dominant flood drivers of an alpine glacierized catchment in the Tianshan region revealed through interpretable deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00918-z,2025-01-26,The Kumalak River, a typical alpine glacierized catchment in the Tianshan region, experiences complex flooding driven by glacier meltwater, snowmelt, and rainfall. However, the mechanisms driving these processes under climate change remain unclear. To address this, a SWAT-Glacier hydrological model and a degree–day factor model were used for snowmelt, glacier meltwater, and rainfall calculations. Two Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models (LSTM-SG and LSTM-DDF) were developed using these inputs, and additive decomposition and integrated gradient methods were applied to interpret flood mechanisms. Glacier meltwater was found to dominate annual maximum flood (AMF) events, while snowmelt drove annual spring maximum flood (AMFSp) events. For AMF events (1960–2018), contributions were 10.01–12.21% from snowmelt, 60.49–60.92% from glacier meltwater, and 26.86–29.50% from rainfall. For AMFSp events (1961–2018), contributions were 48.49–56.08% from snowmelt, 16.12–22.08% from glacier meltwater, and 27.79–29.42% from rainfall. These findings provide critical insights for enhancing flood prediction and optimizing water resource management.

Impacts of irrigation expansion on moist-heat stress based on IRRMIP results,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56356-1,2025-01-26,Irrigation rapidly expanded during the 20<sup><i>t</i><i>h</i></sup> century, affecting climate via water, energy, and biogeochemical changes. Previous assessments of these effects predominantly relied on a single Earth System Model, and therefore suffered from structural model uncertainties. Here we quantify the impacts of historical irrigation expansion on climate by analysing simulation results from six Earth system models participating in the Irrigation Model Intercomparison Project (IRRMIP). Results show that irrigation expansion causes a rapid increase in irrigation water withdrawal, which leads to less frequent 2-meter air temperature heat extremes across heavily irrigated areas (≥4 times less likely). However, due to the irrigation-induced increase in air humidity, the cooling effect of irrigation expansion on moist-heat stress is less pronounced or even reversed, depending on the heat stress metric. In summary, this study indicates that irrigation deployment is not an efficient adaptation measure to escalating human heat stress under climate change, calling for carefully dealing with the increased exposure of local people to moist-heat stress.

For AMF events (1960–2018), contributions were 10.01–12.21% from snowmelt, 60.49–60.92% from glacier meltwater, and 26.86–29.50% from rainfall. For AMFSp events (1961–2018), contributions were 48.49–56.08% from snowmelt, 16.12–22.08% from glacier meltwater, and 27.79–29.42% from rainfall. These findings provide critical insights for enhancing flood prediction and optimizing water resource management.

Impacts of irrigation expansion on moist-heat stress based on IRRMIP results,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56356-1,2025-01-26,Irrigation rapidly expanded during the 20<sup><i>t</i><i>h</i></sup> century, affecting climate via water, energy, and biogeochemical changes. Previous assessments of these effects predominantly relied on a single Earth System Model, and therefore suffered from structural model uncertainties. Here we quantify the impacts of historical irrigation expansion on climate by analysing simulation results from six Earth system models participating in the Irrigation Model Intercomparison Project (IRRMIP). Results show that irrigation expansion causes a rapid increase in irrigation water withdrawal, which leads to less frequent 2-meter air temperature heat extremes across heavily irrigated areas (≥4 times less likely). However, due to the irrigation-induced increase in air humidity, the cooling effect of irrigation expansion on moist-heat stress is less pronounced or even reversed, depending on the heat stress metric. In summary, this study indicates that irrigation deployment is not an efficient adaptation measure to escalating human heat stress under climate change, calling for carefully dealing with the increased exposure of local people to moist-heat stress.

Increasing certainty in projected local extreme precipitation change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56235-9,2025-01-20,The latest climate models project widely varying magnitudes of future extreme precipitation changes, thus impeding effective adaptation planning. Many observational constraints have been proposed to reduce the uncertainty of these projections at global to sub-continental scales, but adaptation generally requires detailed, local scale information. Here, we present a temperature-based adaptative emergent constraint strategy combined with data aggregation that reduces the error variance of projected end-of-century changes in annual extremes of daily precipitation under a high emissions scenario by &gt;20% across most areas of the world. These improved projections could benefit nearly 90% of the world’s population by permitting better impact assessment and adaptation planning at local levels. Our physically motivated strategy, which considers the thermodynamic and dynamic components of projected extreme precipitation change, exploits the link between global warming and the thermodynamic component of extreme precipitation. Rigorous cross-validation provides strong evidence of its reliability in constraining local extreme precipitation projections.

Dichotomy retreat and aqueous alteration on Noachian Mars recorded in highland remnants,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01634-8,2025-01-20,The Mawrth Vallis region is a plateau situated on the highland side of Mars’ hemispheric dichotomy boundary. It has a &gt;200-m-thick phyllosilicate-bearing stratigraphic succession that indicates extensive aqueous alteration between 4.1 Ga and 3.7 Ga, during the Noachian Period. In addition, thousands of kilometre-scale isolated mounds in the lowlands north and west of Mawrth Vallis have been identified. Here we use geomorphological and spectroscopic analyses to show that the mounds are erosional remnants that formed through retreat of the highland plateau in the Noachian. Consequently, the escarpment that marks the surface expression of the dichotomy must have receded south-southeast by hundreds of kilometres in this area. Lateral and stratigraphic geochemical variation in the mounds show that widespread, multiphase aqueous alteration occurred in situ across this region in surface and subsurface environments. The mound succession is underlain by a pyroxene-rich unit that represents unaltered material below the regional phyllosilicate-bearing sequence and is unconformably overlain by a thin capping unit that marks the end of large-scale regional aqueous activity. Thus, the mounds contain a stratigraphic record of the onset, evolution and cessation of Noachian aqueous conditions in this region, detailing the environment and climate of Mars at its most habitable.

Projected runoff declines from plant physiological effects on precipitation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00361-z,2025-01-20,The impact of plants on runoff under high atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is a major uncertainty for future water resources. Theory and Earth system models (ESMs) suggest that stricter plant stomatal regulation under high CO<sub>2</sub> will reduce transpiration, potentially boosting runoff. Yet, across a 12-member ensemble of idealized ESM simulations that isolate plant responses to CO<sub>2</sub>, we show that lower transpiration robustly enhances runoff over only 5% of modelled global land area. Precipitation changes are five times more important than transpiration changes in driving runoff responses and are a significant signal of CO<sub>2</sub> physiological forcing over 31–57% of land areas across models. Crucially, ESMs largely disagree on where physiologically forced precipitation changes occur but agree that plant responses in most locations are as likely to reduce runoff as increase it. These results imply that large model uncertainties in precipitation responses, rather than transpiration responses, explain why ESMs disagree on plant physiologically driven runoff changes.

Measurements of groundwater, hydrodynamics, and sand characteristics at a dissipative sea turtle nesting beach,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04455-5,2025-01-21,Beach groundwater and nearshore hydrodynamic data were collected during a field experiment along two dissipative beach transects on Galveston Island, Texas, in the fall of 2023. The monitored beaches serve as nesting habitat for the critically endangered Kemp’s ridley sea turtle. Conditions ranged from calm to stormy, with two storms occurring during the experiment, inundating the entire beach up to the dune toe. Collected hydrodynamic data include readings from pressure loggers submerged in the foreshore and mounted in groundwater wells in the backshore, data from two wave buoys about 1.5 km offshore, and GoPro timestacks of the instantaneous waterline (wave runup). Other collected data include bathymetry and topography surveys, subsurface temperature and moisture content readings, and sediment characteristics. This comprehensive dataset can be used to (1) study relevant beach inundation and groundwater processes, including their effect on the local ecosystem (e.g., repeated flooding of sea turtle nests), (2) study the propagation of nearshore hydrodynamic processes into the beach matrix and groundwater table, and (3) validate existing beach groundwater models.

The dataset covers the basins of the Laurentian Great Lakes and the Ottawa River and extends over the period 2001–2018. The data consist of all variables (hourly fluxes and state variables) related to the water balance of GEM-Hydro’s land-surface scheme (including precipitation, surface and sub-surface runoff, drainage, evaporation, snow water equivalent, soil moisture…) and mean daily streamflow at 212 gauge locations. These outputs were simulated with a calibrated version of the GEM-Hydro model that was run in open-loop mode (no assimilation) and driven with atmospheric forcings coming from ECCC’s Canadian Surface Reanalysis version 2.1. GEM-Hydro achieves satisfactory simulations of various hydrologic variables when compared to reference datasets. This dataset can be used for example to drive any routing model, compute climatologies or statistics for different hydrologic variables and study their variability as a function of the local geo-morphology, etc.

Multifaceted changes in water availability with a warmer climate,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00913-4,2025-01-24,Climate warming alters spatial and seasonal patterns of surface water availability (P-E), affecting runoff and terrestrial water storage. However, a comprehensive assessment of these changes across various hydroclimates remains lacking. We develop a multi-model ensemble approach to classify global terrestrial hydroclimate into four distinct regimes based on the mean and seasonality of P-E. P-E is projected to become increasingly variable across space and time. Wet regions with low and high seasonality are likely to experience more concentrated increases in wet-season runoff by up to 20%, highlighting potential increases in flood-related vulnerability. Low-seasonality regions exhibit faster wet-season increases and more rapid dry-season decreases in soil moisture, heightening the likelihood of water scarcity and drought. Conversely, dry regions with high seasonality are less sensitive to climate change. These findings underscore the multifaceted impacts of climate change on global water resources, necessitating the need for tailored adaptation strategies for different hydroclimate regimes.

GRAiCE: reconstructing terrestrial water storage anomalies with recurrent neural networks,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04403-3,2025-01-25,The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on (GRACE-FO) missions have provided estimates of Terrestrial Water Storage Anomalies (TWSA) since 2002, enabling the monitoring of global hydrological changes. However, temporal gaps within these datasets and the lack of TWSA observations prior to 2002 limit our understanding of long-term freshwater variability. In this study, we develop GR<i>Ai</i>CE, a set of four global monthly TWSA reconstructions from 1984 to 2021 at 0.5° spatial resolution, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) neural networks. Our models accurately reproduce GRACE/GRACE-FO observations at the global scale and effectively capture the impacts of climate extremes. Overall, GR<i>Ai</i>CE outperforms a previous reference TWSA reconstruction in predicting observed TWSA and provides reliable water budget estimates at the river basin scale. By generating long-term continuous TWSA time series, GR<i>Ai</i>CE will offer valuable insights into the impacts of climate variability and change on freshwater resources.

Shifted dominant flood drivers of an alpine glacierized catchment in the Tianshan region revealed through interpretable deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00918-z,2025-01-26,The Kumalak River, a typical alpine glacierized catchment in the Tianshan region, experiences complex flooding driven by glacier meltwater, snowmelt, and rainfall. However, the mechanisms driving these processes under climate change remain unclear.

Our findings deepen perception into the complex interactions between precipitation, land surface processes, and climate change, offering valuable implications for future water resource management and hydrological modeling.

Chronic nitrogen legacy in the aquifers of China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02016-7,2025-01-28,About half of the global drinking water comes from groundwater, yet groundwater quality is threatened by high nitrate concentrations globally. Our understanding of groundwater nitrate concentrations is often limited by inaccessibility of groundwater and scarcity of nitrate data in groundwater. Here we used machine learning and decision tree-heatmap analysis by compiling nitrate concentrations and isotope data from 4047 groundwater sites across China to understand their dynamics and drivers across gradients of geographical, climate, and human factors. Results show that nitrate concentrations vary substantially over depth and are generally lower in deeper groundwater, indicating potentially higher nitrate removal rates according to nitrate isotopic pattern such as denitrification at depth. At similar groundwater aquifer depths, nitrate concentrations are highest in urban regions with high population density. In addition, nitrate concentrations are generally higher in arid northern China than humid southern China. Interestingly, while groundwater nitrate concentrations are lower at deeper depths, slow groundwater flow also indicates prolonged nitrogen legacy. Although there has been an overall decline in groundwater nitrogen pollution in China since 2016, persistent pollution has lingered. Future strategies for groundwater quality protection in China should address the long-term legacy of nitrate in different aquifers and rising nitrogen levels in groundwater.

Here we address this by introducing a quantitative metric, average daily fraction of precipitation transformed into terrestrial water storage, providing an important advancement into the dynamics of water storage by utilizing the enhanced terrestrial water storage statistical reconstruction method and water storage data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites and their follow-on mission. This study reveals that approximately 64% of land precipitation contributes to terrestrial water storage in global 121 river basins from 2002 to 2021, with evident variations observed across different climatic and geographical regions. Our findings deepen perception into the complex interactions between precipitation, land surface processes, and climate change, offering valuable implications for future water resource management and hydrological modeling.

Chronic nitrogen legacy in the aquifers of China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02016-7,2025-01-28,About half of the global drinking water comes from groundwater, yet groundwater quality is threatened by high nitrate concentrations globally. Our understanding of groundwater nitrate concentrations is often limited by inaccessibility of groundwater and scarcity of nitrate data in groundwater. Here we used machine learning and decision tree-heatmap analysis by compiling nitrate concentrations and isotope data from 4047 groundwater sites across China to understand their dynamics and drivers across gradients of geographical, climate, and human factors. Results show that nitrate concentrations vary substantially over depth and are generally lower in deeper groundwater, indicating potentially higher nitrate removal rates according to nitrate isotopic pattern such as denitrification at depth. At similar groundwater aquifer depths, nitrate concentrations are highest in urban regions with high population density. In addition, nitrate concentrations are generally higher in arid northern China than humid southern China. Interestingly, while groundwater nitrate concentrations are lower at deeper depths, slow groundwater flow also indicates prolonged nitrogen legacy. Although there has been an overall decline in groundwater nitrogen pollution in China since 2016, persistent pollution has lingered. Future strategies for groundwater quality protection in China should address the long-term legacy of nitrate in different aquifers and rising nitrogen levels in groundwater.

Australian water quality trends over two decades show deterioration in the Great Barrier Reef region and recovery in the Murray-Darling Basin,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02044-3,2025-01-29,Understanding river water quality trajectories and drivers is crucial for effective environmental management. Here we present a comprehensive nation-wide water quality trend assessment across Australia with 287 catchments from 2000 to 2019. About half of the catchments show significant trends in the flow-normalised concentration for each parameter analysed. Most of these significant trends are due to changes in concentration-flow relationships rather than long-term trends in flow. Two of Australia’s major river basins show opposing regional patterns in their significant trends. The North East Coast, which largely flows into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, has increasing phosphorus and sediments. This potentially reflects lagged effects of increasing land clearing and fertilisation since 1960s, while land improvement in the region has not yet demonstrated improvement on water quality. The Murray-Darling Basin has decreasing salinity, phosphorus, and sediment, likely driven by effects of a region-scale salinity management interventions and a prolonged drought on catchment processes.

Human-induced water loss potentially threatens sustainable development of sandy regions in China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02046-1,2025-01-30,Water is indispensable for sustainable socioeconomic development, especially in China’s sandy regions. Despite existing studies in sandy regions, the drivers of changes in total water storage and their potential impacts remain inadequately understood. Here we found a 55.97 billion m³ net loss in total water storage from 2002 to 2023 by integrating multiple datasets. Water loss was primarily attributed to increased farmland irrigation (49.56 billion m³) and ecological restoration (37.04 billion m³). In the coming 40 years, water supply capacity will decrease by up to 6.54% and 19.07% under low and high emission scenarios, respectively, requiring reductions in human water consumption of 60% to 135%. This depletion potentially threatens both regional sustainability and national ecological security. This study calls for urgent scientific regulations on water resources, including strict control of local consumption and enhancement of supply capacity.

Global water gaps under future warming levels,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56517-2,2025-01-30,Understanding the impacts of climate change on water resources is crucial for developing effective adaptation strategies. We quantify “water gaps”, or unsustainable water use – the shortfall where water demand exceeds supply, resulting in scarcity. We quantify baseline and future water gaps using a multi-model analysis that incorporates two plausible future warming scenarios. The baseline global water gap stands at 457.9 km<sup>3</sup>/yr, with projections indicating an increase of 26.5 km<sup>3</sup>/yr (+5.8%) and 67.4 km<sup>3</sup>/yr (+14.7%) under 1.5 °C and 3 °C warming scenarios, respectively. These projections highlight the uneven impact of warming levels on water gaps, emphasizing the need for continued climate change mitigation to alleviate stress on water resources. Our results also underscore the unequal adaptation needs across countries and basins, influenced by varying warming scenarios, with important regional differences and model variability complicating future projections. Robust water management strategies are needed to tackle the escalating water scarcity caused by global warming.

Hydrologic outputs generated over the Great Lakes with a calibrated version of the GEM-Hydro model,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04409-x,2025-01-22,This dataset contains outputs from a calibrated version of the GEM-Hydro model developed at Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and is available on the Federated Research Data Repository. The dataset covers the basins of the Laurentian Great Lakes and the Ottawa River and extends over the period 2001–2018. The data consist of all variables (hourly fluxes and state variables) related to the water balance of GEM-Hydro’s land-surface scheme (including precipitation, surface and sub-surface runoff, drainage, evaporation, snow water equivalent, soil moisture…) and mean daily streamflow at 212 gauge locations. These outputs were simulated with a calibrated version of the GEM-Hydro model that was run in open-loop mode (no assimilation) and driven with atmospheric forcings coming from ECCC’s Canadian Surface Reanalysis version 2.1. GEM-Hydro achieves satisfactory simulations of various hydrologic variables when compared to reference datasets. This dataset can be used for example to drive any routing model, compute climatologies or statistics for different hydrologic variables and study their variability as a function of the local geo-morphology, etc.

Multifaceted changes in water availability with a warmer climate,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00913-4,2025-01-24,Climate warming alters spatial and seasonal patterns of surface water availability (P-E), affecting runoff and terrestrial water storage. However, a comprehensive assessment of these changes across various hydroclimates remains lacking. We develop a multi-model ensemble approach to classify global terrestrial hydroclimate into four distinct regimes based on the mean and seasonality of P-E. P-E is projected to become increasingly variable across space and time. Wet regions with low and high seasonality are likely to experience more concentrated increases in wet-season runoff by up to 20%, highlighting potential increases in flood-related vulnerability. Low-seasonality regions exhibit faster wet-season increases and more rapid dry-season decreases in soil moisture, heightening the likelihood of water scarcity and drought. Conversely, dry regions with high seasonality are less sensitive to climate change. These findings underscore the multifaceted impacts of climate change on global water resources, necessitating the need for tailored adaptation strategies for different hydroclimate regimes.

GRAiCE: reconstructing terrestrial water storage anomalies with recurrent neural networks,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04403-3,2025-01-25,The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on (GRACE-FO) missions have provided estimates of Terrestrial Water Storage Anomalies (TWSA) since 2002, enabling the monitoring of global hydrological changes. However, temporal gaps within these datasets and the lack of TWSA observations prior to 2002 limit our understanding of long-term freshwater variability. In this study, we develop GR<i>Ai</i>CE, a set of four global monthly TWSA reconstructions from 1984 to 2021 at 0.5° spatial resolution, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) neural networks. Our models accurately reproduce GRACE/GRACE-FO observations at the global scale and effectively capture the impacts of climate extremes. Overall, GR<i>Ai</i>CE outperforms a previous reference TWSA reconstruction in predicting observed TWSA and provides reliable water budget estimates at the river basin scale. By generating long-term continuous TWSA time series, GR<i>Ai</i>CE will offer valuable insights into the impacts of climate variability and change on freshwater resources.

Shifted dominant flood drivers of an alpine glacierized catchment in the Tianshan region revealed through interpretable deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00918-z,2025-01-26,The Kumalak River, a typical alpine glacierized catchment in the Tianshan region, experiences complex flooding driven by glacier meltwater, snowmelt, and rainfall. However, the mechanisms driving these processes under climate change remain unclear. To address this, a SWAT-Glacier hydrological model and a degree–day factor model were used for snowmelt, glacier meltwater, and rainfall calculations. Two Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models (LSTM-SG and LSTM-DDF) were developed using these inputs, and additive decomposition and integrated gradient methods were applied to interpret flood mechanisms. Glacier meltwater was found to dominate annual maximum flood (AMF) events, while snowmelt drove annual spring maximum flood (AMFSp) events. For AMF events (1960–2018), contributions were 10.01–12.21% from snowmelt, 60.49–60.92% from glacier meltwater, and 26.86–29.50% from rainfall. For AMFSp events (1961–2018), contributions were 48.49–56.08% from snowmelt, 16.12–22.08% from glacier meltwater, and 27.79–29.42% from rainfall. These findings provide critical insights for enhancing flood prediction and optimizing water resource management.

Impacts of irrigation expansion on moist-heat stress based on IRRMIP results,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56356-1,2025-01-26,Irrigation rapidly expanded during the 20<sup><i>t</i><i>h</i></sup> century, affecting climate via water, energy, and biogeochemical changes. Previous assessments of these effects predominantly relied on a single Earth System Model, and therefore suffered from structural model uncertainties. Here we quantify the impacts of historical irrigation expansion on climate by analysing simulation results from six Earth system models participating in the Irrigation Model Intercomparison Project (IRRMIP). Results show that irrigation expansion causes a rapid increase in irrigation water withdrawal, which leads to less frequent 2-meter air temperature heat extremes across heavily irrigated areas (≥4 times less likely). However, due to the irrigation-induced increase in air humidity, the cooling effect of irrigation expansion on moist-heat stress is less pronounced or even reversed, depending on the heat stress metric. In summary, this study indicates that irrigation deployment is not an efficient adaptation measure to escalating human heat stress under climate change, calling for carefully dealing with the increased exposure of local people to moist-heat stress.

For AMFSp events (1961–2018), contributions were 48.49–56.08% from snowmelt, 16.12–22.08% from glacier meltwater, and 27.79–29.42% from rainfall. These findings provide critical insights for enhancing flood prediction and optimizing water resource management.

Impacts of irrigation expansion on moist-heat stress based on IRRMIP results,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56356-1,2025-01-26,Irrigation rapidly expanded during the 20<sup><i>t</i><i>h</i></sup> century, affecting climate via water, energy, and biogeochemical changes. Previous assessments of these effects predominantly relied on a single Earth System Model, and therefore suffered from structural model uncertainties. Here we quantify the impacts of historical irrigation expansion on climate by analysing simulation results from six Earth system models participating in the Irrigation Model Intercomparison Project (IRRMIP). Results show that irrigation expansion causes a rapid increase in irrigation water withdrawal, which leads to less frequent 2-meter air temperature heat extremes across heavily irrigated areas (≥4 times less likely). However, due to the irrigation-induced increase in air humidity, the cooling effect of irrigation expansion on moist-heat stress is less pronounced or even reversed, depending on the heat stress metric. In summary, this study indicates that irrigation deployment is not an efficient adaptation measure to escalating human heat stress under climate change, calling for carefully dealing with the increased exposure of local people to moist-heat stress.

Over 60% precipitation transformed into terrestrial water storage in global river basins from 2002 to 2021,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01967-7,2025-01-27,The crucial role of precipitation as a primary driver for terrestrial water cycle is well-established. However, quantifying the transformation of daily precipitation into terrestrial water storage remains a challenge. Here we address this by introducing a quantitative metric, average daily fraction of precipitation transformed into terrestrial water storage, providing an important advancement into the dynamics of water storage by utilizing the enhanced terrestrial water storage statistical reconstruction method and water storage data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites and their follow-on mission. This study reveals that approximately 64% of land precipitation contributes to terrestrial water storage in global 121 river basins from 2002 to 2021, with evident variations observed across different climatic and geographical regions. Our findings deepen perception into the complex interactions between precipitation, land surface processes, and climate change, offering valuable implications for future water resource management and hydrological modeling.

Chronic nitrogen legacy in the aquifers of China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02016-7,2025-01-28,About half of the global drinking water comes from groundwater, yet groundwater quality is threatened by high nitrate concentrations globally. Our understanding of groundwater nitrate concentrations is often limited by inaccessibility of groundwater and scarcity of nitrate data in groundwater. Here we used machine learning and decision tree-heatmap analysis by compiling nitrate concentrations and isotope data from 4047 groundwater sites across China to understand their dynamics and drivers across gradients of geographical, climate, and human factors. Results show that nitrate concentrations vary substantially over depth and are generally lower in deeper groundwater, indicating potentially higher nitrate removal rates according to nitrate isotopic pattern such as denitrification at depth. At similar groundwater aquifer depths, nitrate concentrations are highest in urban regions with high population density. In addition, nitrate concentrations are generally higher in arid northern China than humid southern China. Interestingly, while groundwater nitrate concentrations are lower at deeper depths, slow groundwater flow also indicates prolonged nitrogen legacy. Although there has been an overall decline in groundwater nitrogen pollution in China since 2016, persistent pollution has lingered. Future strategies for groundwater quality protection in China should address the long-term legacy of nitrate in different aquifers and rising nitrogen levels in groundwater.

Australian water quality trends over two decades show deterioration in the Great Barrier Reef region and recovery in the Murray-Darling Basin,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02044-3,2025-01-29,Understanding river water quality trajectories and drivers is crucial for effective environmental management. Here we present a comprehensive nation-wide water quality trend assessment across Australia with 287 catchments from 2000 to 2019. About half of the catchments show significant trends in the flow-normalised concentration for each parameter analysed. Most of these significant trends are due to changes in concentration-flow relationships rather than long-term trends in flow. Two of Australia’s major river basins show opposing regional patterns in their significant trends. The North East Coast, which largely flows into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, has increasing phosphorus and sediments. This potentially reflects lagged effects of increasing land clearing and fertilisation since 1960s, while land improvement in the region has not yet demonstrated improvement on water quality. The Murray-Darling Basin has decreasing salinity, phosphorus, and sediment, likely driven by effects of a region-scale salinity management interventions and a prolonged drought on catchment processes.

Human-induced water loss potentially threatens sustainable development of sandy regions in China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02046-1,2025-01-30,Water is indispensable for sustainable socioeconomic development, especially in China’s sandy regions. Despite existing studies in sandy regions, the drivers of changes in total water storage and their potential impacts remain inadequately understood. Here we found a 55.97 billion m³ net loss in total water storage from 2002 to 2023 by integrating multiple datasets. Water loss was primarily attributed to increased farmland irrigation (49.56 billion m³) and ecological restoration (37.04 billion m³). In the coming 40 years, water supply capacity will decrease by up to 6.54% and 19.07% under low and high emission scenarios, respectively, requiring reductions in human water consumption of 60% to 135%. This depletion potentially threatens both regional sustainability and national ecological security. This study calls for urgent scientific regulations on water resources, including strict control of local consumption and enhancement of supply capacity.

Global water gaps under future warming levels,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56517-2,2025-01-30,Understanding the impacts of climate change on water resources is crucial for developing effective adaptation strategies. We quantify “water gaps”, or unsustainable water use – the shortfall where water demand exceeds supply, resulting in scarcity. We quantify baseline and future water gaps using a multi-model analysis that incorporates two plausible future warming scenarios. The baseline global water gap stands at 457.9 km<sup>3</sup>/yr, with projections indicating an increase of 26.5 km<sup>3</sup>/yr (+5.8%) and 67.4 km<sup>3</sup>/yr (+14.7%) under 1.5 °C and 3 °C warming scenarios, respectively. These projections highlight the uneven impact of warming levels on water gaps, emphasizing the need for continued climate change mitigation to alleviate stress on water resources. Our results also underscore the unequal adaptation needs across countries and basins, influenced by varying warming scenarios, with important regional differences and model variability complicating future projections. Robust water management strategies are needed to tackle the escalating water scarcity caused by global warming.

Bias-corrected high-resolution temperature and precipitation projections for Canada,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04396-z,2025-02-01,High-resolution precipitation and temperature projections are indispensable for informed decision-making, risk assessment, and planning. Here, we have developed an extensive database (SPQM-CMIP6-CAN) of high-resolution (0.1°) precipitation and temperature projections extending till 2100 at a daily scale for Canada. We employed a novel Semi-Parametric Quantile Mapping (SPQM) methodology to bias-correct the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase-6 (CMIP6) projections for four Shared Socio-economic Pathways. SPQM is simple, yet robust, in reproducing the observed marginal properties, trends, and variability according to future scenarios, while maintaining a smooth transition from observations to projected simulations. The SPQM-CMIP6-CAN database encompasses 693 simulations derived from 34 diverse climate models for precipitation. Similarly, for temperature projections, our database comprises 581 simulations from 27 climate models. These projections are valuable for hydrological, environmental, and ecological studies, offering a comprehensive resource for analyses within these domains. Furthermore, these projections serve as a vital tool for the quantification of uncertainties arising from climate models, their variant configurations, and future scenarios.

Multifaceted changes in water availability with a warmer climate,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00913-4,2025-01-24,Climate warming alters spatial and seasonal patterns of surface water availability (P-E), affecting runoff and terrestrial water storage. However, a comprehensive assessment of these changes across various hydroclimates remains lacking. We develop a multi-model ensemble approach to classify global terrestrial hydroclimate into four distinct regimes based on the mean and seasonality of P-E. P-E is projected to become increasingly variable across space and time. Wet regions with low and high seasonality are likely to experience more concentrated increases in wet-season runoff by up to 20%, highlighting potential increases in flood-related vulnerability. Low-seasonality regions exhibit faster wet-season increases and more rapid dry-season decreases in soil moisture, heightening the likelihood of water scarcity and drought. Conversely, dry regions with high seasonality are less sensitive to climate change. These findings underscore the multifaceted impacts of climate change on global water resources, necessitating the need for tailored adaptation strategies for different hydroclimate regimes.

GRAiCE: reconstructing terrestrial water storage anomalies with recurrent neural networks,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04403-3,2025-01-25,The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on (GRACE-FO) missions have provided estimates of Terrestrial Water Storage Anomalies (TWSA) since 2002, enabling the monitoring of global hydrological changes. However, temporal gaps within these datasets and the lack of TWSA observations prior to 2002 limit our understanding of long-term freshwater variability. In this study, we develop GR<i>Ai</i>CE, a set of four global monthly TWSA reconstructions from 1984 to 2021 at 0.5° spatial resolution, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) neural networks. Our models accurately reproduce GRACE/GRACE-FO observations at the global scale and effectively capture the impacts of climate extremes. Overall, GR<i>Ai</i>CE outperforms a previous reference TWSA reconstruction in predicting observed TWSA and provides reliable water budget estimates at the river basin scale. By generating long-term continuous TWSA time series, GR<i>Ai</i>CE will offer valuable insights into the impacts of climate variability and change on freshwater resources.

Shifted dominant flood drivers of an alpine glacierized catchment in the Tianshan region revealed through interpretable deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00918-z,2025-01-26,The Kumalak River, a typical alpine glacierized catchment in the Tianshan region, experiences complex flooding driven by glacier meltwater, snowmelt, and rainfall. However, the mechanisms driving these processes under climate change remain unclear. To address this, a SWAT-Glacier hydrological model and a degree–day factor model were used for snowmelt, glacier meltwater, and rainfall calculations. Two Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models (LSTM-SG and LSTM-DDF) were developed using these inputs, and additive decomposition and integrated gradient methods were applied to interpret flood mechanisms. Glacier meltwater was found to dominate annual maximum flood (AMF) events, while snowmelt drove annual spring maximum flood (AMFSp) events. For AMF events (1960–2018), contributions were 10.01–12.21% from snowmelt, 60.49–60.92% from glacier meltwater, and 26.86–29.50% from rainfall.

The hidden influence of terrestrial groundwater on salt marsh function and resilience,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00384-6,2025-02-03,Salt marshes are hotspots of nutrient processing and carbon sequestration. So far, studies addressing spatiotemporal variability in and drivers of salt marsh biogeochemical function, carbon storage and resilience have focused on ocean-driven surface hydrologic influences, neglecting effects of terrestrial hydrology through subsurface connections. Here we evaluate drivers of salt marsh redox potential, a proxy for biogeochemical state, through wavelet analyses and information theory using data from seven marshes. The results point to terrestrial groundwater level as a dominant control on redox variability across all sites. Because redox is a key driver of biogeochemical processes, and specifically oxidation of organic matter that sequesters carbon and maintains marsh elevation, these terrestrial influences are critical to understanding marsh function and evolution. The newly identified links between onshore groundwater levels and marsh redox conditions shift the traditional paradigm and suggest that terrestrial hydrology is a primary control on salt marsh carbon sequestration potential and resilience.

The role of climate and population change in global flood exposure and vulnerability,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56654-8,2025-02-03,Flooding is a pervasive natural hazard with wide-ranging impacts on society. Using a high-resolution global flood model considering coastal, fluvial, and pluvial hazards, we clarify the role of climate effects versus population growth effects in changing flood exposure. Between 2020 and 2100, the population likely exposed to 1% annual risk (100-year) flood hazard will increase from 1.6 to 1.9 billion people. Of this change from the 2020 exposure, we attribute 21.1% to climate change, 76.8% to population change, and 2.1% to both climate and population change. The largest driver of uncertainty in exposure is population change, while climate change remains a smaller but still important driver. The global increase in exposure between 2020 and 2100 is primarily driven by low-GDP regions, and by 2100 the lowest GDP areas will make up 63% of the exposure both overall and in urban areas. Urban areas are especially vulnerable in nearly all global regions, and urban areas sensitive to extreme events are expected to see a 33% increase in population exposure. This study highlights the vast inequities in flood exposure, and future work should direct resources and strategies toward sustainable risk mitigation in these areas.

Recent centennial drought on the Tibetan Plateau is outstanding within the past 3500 years,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56687-z,2025-02-03,Given growing concerns about global climate change, it is critical to understand both historical and current shifts in the hydroclimate, particularly in regions critically entwined with global circulation. The Tibetan Plateau, the Earth’s largest and highest plateau, is a nexus for global atmospheric processes, significantly influencing East Asian hydroclimate dynamics through the synergy of the Asian Monsoon and the Westerlies. Yet, understanding historical and recent hydroclimate fluctuations and their wide-ranging ecological and societal consequences remains challenging due to short instrumental observations and partly ambiguous proxy reconstructions. Here, we present a precisely-dated 3476-year precipitation reconstruction derived from tree-ring δ<sup>18</sup>O data on the Tibetan Plateau, representing one of the few multi-millennia-long annually-resolved terrestrial δ<sup>18</sup>O records to date. Our findings reveal that the 20<sup>th</sup> century drought extremes are severe within the past three millennia, and likely linked to the weakening of both the Asian Monsoon and Westerlies due to anthropogenic aerosol emissions.

Australian water quality trends over two decades show deterioration in the Great Barrier Reef region and recovery in the Murray-Darling Basin,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02044-3,2025-01-29,Understanding river water quality trajectories and drivers is crucial for effective environmental management. Here we present a comprehensive nation-wide water quality trend assessment across Australia with 287 catchments from 2000 to 2019. About half of the catchments show significant trends in the flow-normalised concentration for each parameter analysed. Most of these significant trends are due to changes in concentration-flow relationships rather than long-term trends in flow. Two of Australia’s major river basins show opposing regional patterns in their significant trends. The North East Coast, which largely flows into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, has increasing phosphorus and sediments. This potentially reflects lagged effects of increasing land clearing and fertilisation since 1960s, while land improvement in the region has not yet demonstrated improvement on water quality. The Murray-Darling Basin has decreasing salinity, phosphorus, and sediment, likely driven by effects of a region-scale salinity management interventions and a prolonged drought on catchment processes.

Human-induced water loss potentially threatens sustainable development of sandy regions in China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02046-1,2025-01-30,Water is indispensable for sustainable socioeconomic development, especially in China’s sandy regions. Despite existing studies in sandy regions, the drivers of changes in total water storage and their potential impacts remain inadequately understood. Here we found a 55.97 billion m³ net loss in total water storage from 2002 to 2023 by integrating multiple datasets. Water loss was primarily attributed to increased farmland irrigation (49.56 billion m³) and ecological restoration (37.04 billion m³). In the coming 40 years, water supply capacity will decrease by up to 6.54% and 19.07% under low and high emission scenarios, respectively, requiring reductions in human water consumption of 60% to 135%. This depletion potentially threatens both regional sustainability and national ecological security. This study calls for urgent scientific regulations on water resources, including strict control of local consumption and enhancement of supply capacity.

Global water gaps under future warming levels,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56517-2,2025-01-30,Understanding the impacts of climate change on water resources is crucial for developing effective adaptation strategies. We quantify “water gaps”, or unsustainable water use – the shortfall where water demand exceeds supply, resulting in scarcity. We quantify baseline and future water gaps using a multi-model analysis that incorporates two plausible future warming scenarios. The baseline global water gap stands at 457.9 km<sup>3</sup>/yr, with projections indicating an increase of 26.5 km<sup>3</sup>/yr (+5.8%) and 67.4 km<sup>3</sup>/yr (+14.7%) under 1.5 °C and 3 °C warming scenarios, respectively. These projections highlight the uneven impact of warming levels on water gaps, emphasizing the need for continued climate change mitigation to alleviate stress on water resources. Our results also underscore the unequal adaptation needs across countries and basins, influenced by varying warming scenarios, with important regional differences and model variability complicating future projections. Robust water management strategies are needed to tackle the escalating water scarcity caused by global warming.

Bias-corrected high-resolution temperature and precipitation projections for Canada,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04396-z,2025-02-01,High-resolution precipitation and temperature projections are indispensable for informed decision-making, risk assessment, and planning. Here, we have developed an extensive database (SPQM-CMIP6-CAN) of high-resolution (0.1°) precipitation and temperature projections extending till 2100 at a daily scale for Canada. We employed a novel Semi-Parametric Quantile Mapping (SPQM) methodology to bias-correct the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase-6 (CMIP6) projections for four Shared Socio-economic Pathways. SPQM is simple, yet robust, in reproducing the observed marginal properties, trends, and variability according to future scenarios, while maintaining a smooth transition from observations to projected simulations. The SPQM-CMIP6-CAN database encompasses 693 simulations derived from 34 diverse climate models for precipitation. Similarly, for temperature projections, our database comprises 581 simulations from 27 climate models. These projections are valuable for hydrological, environmental, and ecological studies, offering a comprehensive resource for analyses within these domains. Furthermore, these projections serve as a vital tool for the quantification of uncertainties arising from climate models, their variant configurations, and future scenarios.

The hidden influence of terrestrial groundwater on salt marsh function and resilience,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00384-6,2025-02-03,Salt marshes are hotspots of nutrient processing and carbon sequestration. So far, studies addressing spatiotemporal variability in and drivers of salt marsh biogeochemical function, carbon storage and resilience have focused on ocean-driven surface hydrologic influences, neglecting effects of terrestrial hydrology through subsurface connections. Here we evaluate drivers of salt marsh redox potential, a proxy for biogeochemical state, through wavelet analyses and information theory using data from seven marshes. The results point to terrestrial groundwater level as a dominant control on redox variability across all sites. Because redox is a key driver of biogeochemical processes, and specifically oxidation of organic matter that sequesters carbon and maintains marsh elevation, these terrestrial influences are critical to understanding marsh function and evolution. The newly identified links between onshore groundwater levels and marsh redox conditions shift the traditional paradigm and suggest that terrestrial hydrology is a primary control on salt marsh carbon sequestration potential and resilience.

The role of climate and population change in global flood exposure and vulnerability,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56654-8,2025-02-03,Flooding is a pervasive natural hazard with wide-ranging impacts on society. Using a high-resolution global flood model considering coastal, fluvial, and pluvial hazards, we clarify the role of climate effects versus population growth effects in changing flood exposure. Between 2020 and 2100, the population likely exposed to 1% annual risk (100-year) flood hazard will increase from 1.6 to 1.9 billion people. Of this change from the 2020 exposure, we attribute 21.1% to climate change, 76.8% to population change, and 2.1% to both climate and population change. The largest driver of uncertainty in exposure is population change, while climate change remains a smaller but still important driver. The global increase in exposure between 2020 and 2100 is primarily driven by low-GDP regions, and by 2100 the lowest GDP areas will make up 63% of the exposure both overall and in urban areas. Urban areas are especially vulnerable in nearly all global regions, and urban areas sensitive to extreme events are expected to see a 33% increase in population exposure. This study highlights the vast inequities in flood exposure, and future work should direct resources and strategies toward sustainable risk mitigation in these areas.

Recent centennial drought on the Tibetan Plateau is outstanding within the past 3500 years,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56687-z,2025-02-03,Given growing concerns about global climate change, it is critical to understand both historical and current shifts in the hydroclimate, particularly in regions critically entwined with global circulation. The Tibetan Plateau, the Earth’s largest and highest plateau, is a nexus for global atmospheric processes, significantly influencing East Asian hydroclimate dynamics through the synergy of the Asian Monsoon and the Westerlies. Yet, understanding historical and recent hydroclimate fluctuations and their wide-ranging ecological and societal consequences remains challenging due to short instrumental observations and partly ambiguous proxy reconstructions. Here, we present a precisely-dated 3476-year precipitation reconstruction derived from tree-ring δ<sup>18</sup>O data on the Tibetan Plateau, representing one of the few multi-millennia-long annually-resolved terrestrial δ<sup>18</sup>O records to date. Our findings reveal that the 20<sup>th</sup> century drought extremes are severe within the past three millennia, and likely linked to the weakening of both the Asian Monsoon and Westerlies due to anthropogenic aerosol emissions. Additionally, our analyses identified three distinct stages (110 BC–AD 280, AD 330–770 and AD 950–1300) characterized by shifts toward arid hydroclimate conditions, corresponding to significant social unrest and dynasty collapses, which underscores the potential societal impacts of severe hydroclimatic shifts.

In-soil and above ground microclimate and ET data are presented on a 15-minute interval as are weather data for all days of the year. Data analysis determined ET, precipitation, irrigation, and dew and frost accumulation on a 15-minute basis from lysimeter mass data. Soil water content data from calibrated neutron probe readings is presented on a periodic basis. Crop planting, harvest, fertilization, pest control, and other agronomic information are presented in agronomic calendars by day of year. Crop growth data are presented on a periodic basis throughout the growing season, as are final crop biomass and yield data.

Hyper-resolution naturalized streamflow data for Geum River in South Korea (1951–2020),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04486-y,2025-02-04,Long-term streamflow data at a hyper-resolution (less than 1 km) is essential for hydroclimatic extreme and ecological assessment, which is not available over a river basin where rapid socioeconomic growth have been experienced. Here, we use the Variable Infiltration Capacity-River Routing Model (VIC-RRM) to reconstruct naturalized daily streamflow at 90–meter resolution for the Geum River, one of South Korea’s major rivers, over 1951–2020. VIC-RRM demonstrates high temporal consistency with a correlation coefficient exceeding 0.6 for observed streamflow seasonality at over 60% of the 90 gauge stations along the Geum River. However, 36% of the stations show low modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (0.2–0.4), primarily due to uncertainties in runoff data and human disturbance impacts like irrigation and reservoir storage. Our simulated naturalized data reveal decadal variability in the 1990s and an increase in day-to-day variability of the Geum River in the 2010s compared to those in the 1970s. This dataset provides physically consistent naturalized streamflow data for reference data to evaluate climate change-driven changes in streamflow for the Geum River.

Yet despite the key role that croplands play in global land use and Earth systems, there remains little understanding of how spatial patterns of global crop cultivation have recently evolved and which crops have contributed most to these changes. Here we construct a new data library of subnational crop-specific irrigated and rainfed harvested area statistics and combine it with global gridded land cover products to develop a global gridded (5-arcminute) irrigated and rainfed cropped area (MIRCA-OS) dataset for the years 2000 to 2015 for 23 crop classes. These global data products support critical insights into the spatially detailed patterns of irrigated and rainfed cropland change since the start of the century and provide an improved foundation for a wide array of global assessments spanning agriculture, water resource management, land use change, climate impact, and sustainable development.

To this end, an enhanced rainfall-induced landslide catalogue, e-ITALICA, is presented here. e-ITALICA contains spatial and temporal information on 6312 rainfall-induced landslides that occurred in Italy between 1996 and 2021 (already listed in the previous ITALICA catalogue published in 2023), with the addition of their rainfall triggering conditions in terms of rainfall duration <i>D</i> (h) and cumulative event rainfall <i>E</i> (mm). The triggering conditions are calculated using hourly rainfall measurements from 4033 rain gauges and applying a rigorous and reproducible method. In addition, topographic and land cover information is also provided. e-ITALICA can be used to analyse rainfall conditions capable of triggering landslides, to calibrate and validate physically based landslide prediction models, and to define empirical rainfall thresholds from local to national scales in Italy, thus contributing to landslide risk reduction.

The land–ocean Arctic carbon cycle,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-024-00627-w,2025-02-06,Anthropogenic climate warming is amplified in the Arctic, impacting the Arctic carbon cycle and its role in regulating climate and global biogeochemical cycles. In this Review, we provide a quantitative and comprehensive overview of the present-day Arctic carbon cycle across the land–ocean continuum. Terrestrial soil stocks total 877 ± 16 Pg C, with upper marine sediments containing 82 ± 35 Pg C. Overall, the integrated Arctic system is a carbon sink, driven by oceanic uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> (127 ± 36 Tg C year<sup>−1</sup>) and organic carbon burial in shelf sea sediments (112 ± 41 Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>). Terrestrial systems, including inland waters and disturbance, are a net source of CH<sub>4</sub> (38 (21, 53) Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>) and CO<sub>2</sub> (12 (–606, 661) Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>). The Arctic carbon sink will likely weaken under continued warming, owing to factors such as increased coastal erosion, outgassing of riverine organic carbon and enhanced nearshore carbon turnover lowering shelf sediment burial. Arctic greening and increases in terrestrial carbon sinks will be substantially offset by increases in soil respiration, disturbance from extreme events and enhanced emissions from inland waters. Future research should prioritize enhanced coverage of small catchments and nearshore regions, and inclusion of non-linear responses in biogeochemical models.

However, 36% of the stations show low modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (0.2–0.4), primarily due to uncertainties in runoff data and human disturbance impacts like irrigation and reservoir storage. Our simulated naturalized data reveal decadal variability in the 1990s and an increase in day-to-day variability of the Geum River in the 2010s compared to those in the 1970s. This dataset provides physically consistent naturalized streamflow data for reference data to evaluate climate change-driven changes in streamflow for the Geum River.

A global open-source dataset of monthly irrigated and rainfed cropped areas (MIRCA-OS) for the 21st century,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-04313-w,2025-02-04,Crop production is among the most extensive human activities on the planet – with critical importance for global food security, land use, environmental burden, and climate. Yet despite the key role that croplands play in global land use and Earth systems, there remains little understanding of how spatial patterns of global crop cultivation have recently evolved and which crops have contributed most to these changes. Here we construct a new data library of subnational crop-specific irrigated and rainfed harvested area statistics and combine it with global gridded land cover products to develop a global gridded (5-arcminute) irrigated and rainfed cropped area (MIRCA-OS) dataset for the years 2000 to 2015 for 23 crop classes. These global data products support critical insights into the spatially detailed patterns of irrigated and rainfed cropland change since the start of the century and provide an improved foundation for a wide array of global assessments spanning agriculture, water resource management, land use change, climate impact, and sustainable development.

An enhanced rainfall-induced landslide catalogue in Italy,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04551-6,2025-02-05,With the increasing use of data-driven landslide prediction models also based on artificial intelligence, the availability of accurate information on the occurrence of landslides and the rigorous reconstruction of their triggering rainfall conditions are crucial. To this end, an enhanced rainfall-induced landslide catalogue, e-ITALICA, is presented here. e-ITALICA contains spatial and temporal information on 6312 rainfall-induced landslides that occurred in Italy between 1996 and 2021 (already listed in the previous ITALICA catalogue published in 2023), with the addition of their rainfall triggering conditions in terms of rainfall duration <i>D</i> (h) and cumulative event rainfall <i>E</i> (mm). The triggering conditions are calculated using hourly rainfall measurements from 4033 rain gauges and applying a rigorous and reproducible method. In addition, topographic and land cover information is also provided. e-ITALICA can be used to analyse rainfall conditions capable of triggering landslides, to calibrate and validate physically based landslide prediction models, and to define empirical rainfall thresholds from local to national scales in Italy, thus contributing to landslide risk reduction.

The land–ocean Arctic carbon cycle,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-024-00627-w,2025-02-06,Anthropogenic climate warming is amplified in the Arctic, impacting the Arctic carbon cycle and its role in regulating climate and global biogeochemical cycles. In this Review, we provide a quantitative and comprehensive overview of the present-day Arctic carbon cycle across the land–ocean continuum. Terrestrial soil stocks total 877 ± 16 Pg C, with upper marine sediments containing 82 ± 35 Pg C. Overall, the integrated Arctic system is a carbon sink, driven by oceanic uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> (127 ± 36 Tg C year<sup>−1</sup>) and organic carbon burial in shelf sea sediments (112 ± 41 Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>). Terrestrial systems, including inland waters and disturbance, are a net source of CH<sub>4</sub> (38 (21, 53) Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>) and CO<sub>2</sub> (12 (–606, 661) Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>). The Arctic carbon sink will likely weaken under continued warming, owing to factors such as increased coastal erosion, outgassing of riverine organic carbon and enhanced nearshore carbon turnover lowering shelf sediment burial. Arctic greening and increases in terrestrial carbon sinks will be substantially offset by increases in soil respiration, disturbance from extreme events and enhanced emissions from inland waters. Future research should prioritize enhanced coverage of small catchments and nearshore regions, and inclusion of non-linear responses in biogeochemical models.

Not as random: the stable dynamics controlling shallow convective clouds,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00924-1,2025-02-07,Shallow, sparse, non-precipitating convective clouds forming over the ocean are considered among the least organized cloud fields. The formation mechanism of these clouds is associated with random, local perturbations that create buoyant parcels. Their sparseness suggests no or very weak interactions between clouds. Here, we show that such clouds form within a well-organized, stable, dense mesh of convective cells that operate continuously, independent of the presence of visible clouds.npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Rising groundwater table due to restoration projects amplifies earthquake induced liquefaction risk in Beijing,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56525-2,2025-02-08,Groundwater restoration is increasingly common to mitigate groundwater overexploitation, which proves effective in resolving urban water scarcity and regional unsustainable development. China’s South-to-North Water Diversion Project is one of the largest water transfer projects to restore groundwater and resolve water shortage in Beijing. However, how the rapidly restored groundwater of this magnitude changes regional seismic stability is largely unknown. Here, we explore the relation between elevated groundwater table and seismic ground liquefaction based on the case of Beijing under the impact of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. We collect groundwater table depth records and use them to drive three-dimensional geotechnical models that generate ground liquefaction hazard maps. We find a remarkable increase in coverage and severity of liquefaction due to groundwater table rise. Infrastructures built during the rapid urbanization process are often under low groundwater table and thus illy prepared for this increased seismic risk. These findings highlight the necessity to consider the seismic consequence of large-scale groundwater restoration projects.,Nature Communications
Wildfires mediate carbon transfer from land to lakes across boreal and temperate regions,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02070-1,2025-02-08,Wildfires can disrupt carbon transport from land to water, but how lake carbon cycling responds to fires remains unclear. Here, we analyzed the concentration and dominance of the main carbon forms in total carbon pools in 54 lakes (34 burned, 20 control) across 3 regions of Quebec, Canada and Minnesota, USA from recent wildfires ( &lt; 1 – 3 years). Lakes in burned watersheds had up to double the dissolved organic carbon concentrations of control lakes, and the fire effect was most apparent when accounting for climate and landscape drivers (e.g., catchment to lake area ratio) of lake carbon cycling. The greater quantity and dominance of dissolved organic carbon in burned lakes over other carbon forms with different turnover rates and fates suggest a potential fire-mediated carbon export up to several years post fire with a yet undetermined fate in northern forested watersheds and with important implications for regional to global carbon budgets.,Communications Earth & Environment
An annotated satellite imagery dataset for automated river barrier object detection,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04590-z,2025-02-10,Millions of river barriers have been constructed worldwide for flood control, hydropower generation, and agricultural irrigation. The lack of comprehensive records on river barriers’ locations and types, particularly small barriers including weirs, limits our ability to assess their societal and environmental impacts. Integrating satellite imagery with object detection algorithms holds promise for the automatic identification of river barriers on a global scale. However, achieving this objective requires high-quality image datasets for algorithm training and testing. Hence, this study presents a large-scale dataset named the River Barrier Object Detection (RBOD). It comprises 4,872 high-resolution satellite images and 11,741 meticulously annotated oriented bounding boxes (OBBs), encompassing five classes of river barriers. The effectiveness of the RBOD dataset was validated using five typical object detection algorithms, which provide performance benchmarks for future applications. To the best of our knowledge, RBOD is the first publicly available dataset for river barrier object detection, providing a valuable resource for the understanding and management of river barriers.,Scientific Data
Emergent constraints indicate slower increases in future global evapotranspiration,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00932-1,2025-02-12,Projections of global terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) are plagued by sizeable uncertainties. Here, we uncover bivariate emergent constraint relationships between projected global ET trends (2015–2100) and historical vapour pressure deficit (VPD) trends (1980–2014) under the low emission scenario of SSP126 when water supply is sufficient, and with historical precipitation trends under the high emission scenarios of SSP370 and SSP585 when water availability is limited, across 28 CMIP6 models. Combining multiple observational datasets into a Hierarchical Emergent Constraint framework, we find the raw CMIP6 models overestimate future annual ET growth rates. The original projections of 0.233 ± 0.107 mm year<sup>−1</sup> (SSP126), 0.360 ± 0.244 mm year−<sup>1</sup> (SSP370) and 0.506 ± 0.365 mm year<sup>−1</sup> (SSP585) are adjusted downwards to 0.193 ± 0.074 mm year<sup>−1</sup>, 0.272 ± 0.184 mm year<sup>−1</sup> and 0.391 ± 0.299 mm year<sup>−1</sup>. The revised projection uncertainties are reduced by 18.1–31.1%. These findings highlight the value of incorporating observational constraints to improve the reliability of ET projections, which are critical for understanding the future global water cycle.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Contrasting impacts of irrigation and deforestation on Lancang-Mekong River Basin hydrology,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02093-8,2025-02-12,Irrigation expansion and subsequent deforestation substantially affect large basin variability. However, given the complex interactions between hydrological variables, a more comprehensive understanding of the hydrological impacts within the coexisting land use changes is needed. Here, we applied surface-groundwater-coupled simulations with historical river gauges and satellite observations to evaluate long-term and seasonal changes in Lancang-Mekong River Basin hydrology. Increasing irrigation elevated soil moisture but depleted groundwater storage. Conversely, deforestation reduced soil moisture, and increased lateral flow in areas with steep terrain compensated for groundwater depletion. Irrigation affected runoff by augmenting evapotranspiration and baseflow, which had opposite implications for runoff changes, causing a mixed spatial pattern of decreases and increases. Meanwhile, decreases in soil moisture due to deforestation offset increases in evapotranspiration due to irrigation, resulting in wider areas of runoff increases than decreases. These illustrate the distinct hydrological impacts of different land use changes and a pathway to complex system assessments.,Communications Earth & Environment
Deciphering the role of evapotranspiration in declining relative humidity trends over land,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02076-9,2025-02-12,In recent decades, relative humidity over land has declined, driving increases in droughts and wildfires. Previous explanations attribute this trend to insufficient moisture advection from the ocean to sustain the current level, but this ignores atmospheric moisture supplied from terrestrial evapotranspiration. Importantly, current state-of-the-art climate models continue to underestimate the observed relative humidity trend over land. Here, we show that changes in specific humidity over land relative to a given baseline, unaccounted for by ocean advection, are quantitatively equivalent to relative changes in evapotranspiration on a global scale. This finding is consistent across climate models and climate reanalysis datasets, despite discrepancies in evapotranspiration trends among them. Differences in evapotranspiration trends are identified as a prominent cause of the bias in relative humidity trend expressed in climate models. These results suggest that current climate models may overestimate evapotranspiration intensifications, leading to an underestimation of atmospheric drying, with critical implications for accurately predicting droughts, wildfires, and climate adaptation.,Communications Earth & Environment
A high resolution, gridded product for vapor pressure deficit using Daymet,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04544-5,2025-02-12,Vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is a critical variable in assessing drought conditions and evaluating plant water stress. Gridded products of global and regional VPD are not freely available from satellite remote sensing, model reanalysis, or ground observation datasets. We present two versions of the first gridded VPD product for the Continental US and parts of Northern Mexico and Southern Canada (CONUS+) at a 1 km spatial resolution and daily time step. We derived VPD from Daymet maximum daily temperature and average daily vapor pressure and scale the estimates based on (1) climate determined by the Köppen-Geiger classifications and (2) land cover determined by the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme. Ground-based VPD data from 253 AmeriFlux sites representing different climate and land cover classifications were used to improve the Daymet-derived VPD estimates for every pixel in the CONUS+ grid to produce the final datasets. We evaluated the Daymet-derived VPD against independent observations and reanalysis data. The CONUS+ VPD datasets will aid in investigating disturbances including drought and wildfire, and informing land management strategies.,Scientific Data

Original vegetation condition and precipitation growth rate bifurcate sediment flux trend on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02075-w,2025-02-07,Riverine sediment flux on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau follows separate trends in different headwater basins because of complicated pathways under global warming. Here we successfully reconstructed historical sediment fluxes from seven pathways at 25 hydrological stations during 1982 ~ 2022 using a conceptual Multivariate Climate Elasticity Model based on Taylor expansion and revealed the bifurcation in sediment flux trend. Significantly increasing trends occurred at five stations, caused either by elevated runoff from increased precipitation (contributing -10 ~ 50%) or by temperature modifying the underlying surface (-12 ~ 100%). Significantly decreasing trends were found at six stations, primarily owing to vegetation expansion (11 ~ 100%). Combinations of original vegetation condition and increasing rate of precipitation are pivotal for bifurcating the sediment flux trend. In the future, slowly increasing precipitation with greatly increasing temperature or poor original vegetation condition followed by rapid vegetation expansion may decelerate sediment yield, whereas rapidly increasing precipitation may overwhelm the marginal conservation effect of plentiful vegetation.,Communications Earth & Environment

Gridded products of global and regional VPD are not freely available from satellite remote sensing, model reanalysis, or ground observation datasets. We present two versions of the first gridded VPD product for the Continental US and parts of Northern Mexico and Southern Canada (CONUS+) at a 1 km spatial resolution and daily time step. We derived VPD from Daymet maximum daily temperature and average daily vapor pressure and scale the estimates based on (1) climate determined by the Köppen-Geiger classifications and (2) land cover determined by the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme. Ground-based VPD data from 253 AmeriFlux sites representing different climate and land cover classifications were used to improve the Daymet-derived VPD estimates for every pixel in the CONUS+ grid to produce the final datasets. We evaluated the Daymet-derived VPD against independent observations and reanalysis data. The CONUS+ VPD datasets will aid in investigating disturbances including drought and wildfire, and informing land management strategies.,Scientific DataDeciphering the role of evapotranspiration in declining relative humidity trends over land,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02076-9,2025-02-12,In recent decades, relative humidity over land has declined, driving increases in droughts and wildfires. Previous explanations attribute this trend to insufficient moisture advection from the ocean to sustain the current level, but this ignores atmospheric moisture supplied from terrestrial evapotranspiration. Importantly, current state-of-the-art climate models continue to underestimate the observed relative humidity trend over land. Here, we show that changes in specific humidity over land relative to a given baseline, unaccounted for by ocean advection, are quantitatively equivalent to relative changes in evapotranspiration on a global scale. This finding is consistent across climate models and climate reanalysis datasets, despite discrepancies in evapotranspiration trends among them. Differences in evapotranspiration trends are identified as a prominent cause of the bias in relative humidity trend expressed in climate models. These results suggest that current climate models may overestimate evapotranspiration intensifications, leading to an underestimation of atmospheric drying, with critical implications for accurately predicting droughts, wildfires, and climate adaptation.,Communications Earth & Environment

Climate change effects on submarine groundwater discharge and regional variations along the Korean Peninsula,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02084-9,2025-02-14,Climate change impacts fresh submarine groundwater discharge on the Korean Peninsula, increasing the vulnerability of coastal regions to environmental degradation and economic consequences. Here, we provide regional estimates of fresh submarine groundwater discharge along the entire coast using established water balance methods. Our findings reveal that the western and southern coasts of the southern Korean Peninsula exhibit higher fresh submarine groundwater discharge rates due to greater net precipitation compared to the northern Korean Peninsula. Differences in drainage length between the east and west coasts, along with substantial tidal flats, significantly influence submarine groundwater discharge rates. Climate change drives variations in fresh submarine groundwater discharge, with rising trends in the southern Korean Peninsula during spring and winter, while the northern coastal watersheds show consistent increases across all seasons. Coastal vulnerability to offshore contamination from land use development affects 15% of the coastline. Notably, between 1990 and 2020, the risk in the southern Korean Peninsula’s coastal catchments increased by 38%. Our analysis also highlights heightened vulnerability to saltwater intrusion in the southwestern Korean Peninsula.,Communications Earth & Environment
The Water Health Open Knowledge Graph,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04537-4,2025-02-15,Global sustainability challenges have recently led to an increasing interest in the management of water and health resources. Thus, the availability of effective, meaningful and open data is crucial to address those issues in the broader context of the Sustainable Development Goals of clean water and sanitation as targeted by the United Nations. In this paper, we present the Water Health Open Knowledge Graph (WHOW-KG) along with its design methodology and analysis on impact. Developed in the context of the EU-funded WHOW (Water Health Open Knowledge) project, the WHOW-KG is a semantic knowledge graph that models data on water consumption, pollution, extreme weather events, infectious disease rates and drug distribution. Indeed, it aims at supporting a wide range of applications: from knowledge discovery to decision-making, making it a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners in the water and health domains. The WHOW-KG consists of a network of five ontologies and related linked open data, modelled according to those ontologies. As a fully distributed system, it is sustainable over time, can handle large datasets, and allows data providers full control, establishing it as a vital European asset in the fields of water consumption and pollution.,Scientific Data
Progressively smaller glacier lake outburst floods despite worldwide growth in lake area,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-025-00388-w,2025-02-18,Glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs) may originate from larger lakes as these continue to grow with ongoing glacier retreat; however, this perception remains poorly supported in available GLOF databases. Here we mapped the areas of 1,686 glacier lakes, just before they drained, across 13 glaciated mountain regions outside polar regions and examined the trends in pre-GLOF lake areas between 1990 and 2023. We found that pre-GLOF lake areas barely changed, or even decreased, regionally through time, even as the total lake area, and thus hazard potential, grew overall. This counterintuitive finding reflects limits to growing GLOF magnitudes, such as the decoupling of lakes and parent glaciers, the development of wide, low-gradient outlets or human management. Across all regions, pre-GLOF lake areas depend on a few ice-dammed lakes, which have produced ten times more reported outbursts and ten times larger outbursts than moraine- and bedrock-dammed lakes. The latter two dam types will continue to impound growing amounts of meltwater, thereby accounting for most of the overall GLOF hazard potential, while ice-dammed lakes will shrink with deglaciation. As these lake types will evolve differently in the twenty-first century, we call for customized simulations of GLOF outflows and impacts, given the growing exposure of critical infrastructure.,Nature Water
Community estimate of global glacier mass changes from 2000 to 2023,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08545-z,2025-02-19,Glaciers are indicators of ongoing anthropogenic climate change<sup>1</sup>. Their melting leads to increased local geohazards<sup>2</sup>, and impacts marine<sup>3</sup> and terrestrial<sup>4,5</sup> ecosystems, regional freshwater resources<sup>6</sup>, and both global water and energy cycles<sup>7,8</sup>. Together with the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, glaciers are essential drivers of present<sup>9,10</sup> and future<sup>11,12,13</sup> sea-level rise. Previous assessments of global glacier mass changes have been hampered by spatial and temporal limitations and the heterogeneity of existing data series<sup>14,15,16</sup>. Here we show in an intercomparison exercise that glaciers worldwide lost 273 ± 16 gigatonnes in mass annually from 2000 to 2023, with an increase of 36 ± 10% from the first (2000–2011) to the second (2012–2023) half of the period. Since 2000, glaciers have lost between 2% and 39% of their ice regionally and about 5% globally. Glacier mass loss is about 18% larger than the loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet and more than twice that from the Antarctic Ice Sheet<sup>17</sup>. Our results arise from a scientific community effort to collect, homogenize, combine and analyse glacier mass changes from in situ and remote-sensing observations. Although our estimates are in agreement with findings from previous assessments<sup>14,15,16</sup> at a global scale, we found some large regional deviations owing to systematic differences among observation methods. Our results provide a refined baseline for better understanding observational differences and for calibrating model ensembles<sup>12,16,18</sup>, which will help to narrow projection uncertainty for the twenty-first century<sup>11,12,18</sup>.,Nature
UAS hydrometry: contactless river water level, bathymetry, and flow velocity – the Rӧnne river dataset,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04611-x,2025-02-19,High-resolution monitoring of rivers becomes important because more frequent and severe flooding and drought events are expected in the future, caused by climate change. Some key hydrometric variables (water surface elevation, bathymetry, and water surface velocity) can be acquired at high spatial resolution and in a contactless and noninvasive way using Unoccupied Aerial Systems (UAS). This paper presents a large publicly available UAS hydrometric dataset surveyed within a 10 km stretch of Rönne Å in Sweden from 28 August to 1 September 2023. The data were acquired using UAS radar altimetry for water surface elevation mapping, UAS water penetrating radar and UAS sonar for bathymetric mapping, and UAS Doppler radar for surface velocity monitoring. All data are divided into three processing levels: the raw data (Level 1), processed point data (Level 2), and point data referenced to a reference river centerline/reference cross section line (Level 3). In-situ ground truth and legacy UAS hydrometry payload data are included for comparison and validation. Good consistency indicates that the new UAS hydrometry payloads provide satisfactory datasets.,Scientific Data
Global Future Drought Layers Based on Downscaled CMIP6 Models and Multiple Socioeconomic Pathways,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04612-w,2025-02-19,Droughts are a natural hazard of growing concern as they are projected to increase in frequency and severity for many regions of the world. The identification of droughts and their future characteristics is essential to building an understanding of the geography and magnitude of potential drought change trajectories, which in turn is critical information to manage drought resilience across multiple sectors and disciplines. Adding to this effort, we developed a dataset of global historical and projected future drought indices over the 1980–2100 period based on downscaled CMIP6 models across multiple shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP). The dataset is composed of two indices: the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) for 23 downscaled global climate models (GCMs) (0.25-degree resolution), including historical (1980–2014) and future projections (2015–2100) under four climate scenarios: SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5. The drought indices were calculated for 3-, 6- and 12-month accumulation timescales and are available as gridded spatial datasets in a regular latitude-longitude format at monthly time resolution.,Scientific Data

A dataset for monitoring agricultural drought in Europe,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-04199-8,2025-02-20,This paper introduces the Combined Drought Indicator dataset, a collection of raster maps generated by the Copernicus European Drought Observatory for monitoring agricultural drought in Europe. Computationally, the CDI involves three indicators: the Standardized Precipitation Index, the Soil Moisture Anomaly and the Fraction of the Photosyntetically Active Radiation anomaly. These are complemented by the use of crop and snow masks. The CDI dataset has a spatial resolution of 1/24 decimal degrees (∼5 km), a temporal resolution of 10 days and is available from 2012 onward. As drought effects are variegated both in space and time, the CDI provides an effective instrument for assessing the different stages of propagation of agricultural drought and their spatial extent. Furthermore, the CDI maps provide relevant information for those private and public actors (water resource agencies, farmers, land managers and so on) involved both in drought preparedness and planning to mitigate drought impacts. Users can access and download the dataset from the Copernicus European Drought Observatory web portal, where an online mapviewer and clickable maps facilitate its interactive exploration.,Scientific Data
Waterfalls enhance regional methane emissions by enabling dissolved methane to bypass microbial oxidation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02060-3,2025-02-23,River waters are significant sources of atmospheric methane whose local emissions increase with river slope and turbulence. However, when integrated regionally, the amount of dissolved methane released to the atmosphere is uninfluenced by local changes in turbulence when no additional loss mechanisms are present. Here we tested the hypothesis that waterfalls enhance both local and regional atmospheric methane emissions if microbial methane oxidation is significant in river waters. Rates of net atmospheric emission and net aerobic methane oxidation were measured in river waters containing waterfalls across western New York revealing that methane oxidation can diminish atmospheric emissions when turbulence is less. However, at waterfalls, 88 ± 1% of the dissolved methane supersaturation was released to the atmosphere, increasing net methane emission rates substantially beyond oxidation (0.1–16.2 × 10<sup>6 </sup>nM d<sup>-1</sup> for waterfall emission; 10–39 nM d<sup>-1</sup> for oxidation), and ultimately enhancing regional methane emissions by enabling dissolved methane to bypass an oxidative sink.,Communications Earth & Environment
A 150-year river water quality record shows reductions in phosphorus loads but not in algal growth potential,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01978-4,2025-02-24,Eutrophication and proliferation of nuisance and harmful algal blooms are a major cause of water-quality impairment globally. Here, we analyze the world’s longest continuous (150-year) river water-quality dataset for the River Thames, U.K. (including biological oxygen demand, chloride, phosphorus and silica), to explore the impacts of urbanization, wastewater discharges and agricultural intensification. Over the last 40 years, improvements in wastewater treatment and agricultural management have reduced phosphorus loads by ~80%. However, this has been insufficient to curtail river algal blooms because nutrient concentrations remain above limiting levels. Over the last 50–60 years, rising water temperatures have increased the number of days with water temperatures favourable for diatom blooms in March-April and for cyanobacterial growth in July-August. These results highlight the challenges of eutrophication management in a warming climate and a strategic need to redouble efforts in further reducing nutrient emissions to control nuisance and increasingly harmful algal blooms.,Communications Earth & Environment
A station-based 0.1-degree daily gridded ensemble precipitation dataset for India,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04474-2,2025-02-25,Gridded precipitation products are inherently uncertain and predominantly deterministic, which limits their applicability in data assimilation systems and hydrologic modeling. This limitation is significant in developing countries such as India, where the observation network is sparse and non-uniform, topography is complex, and hydrometeorological extremes are frequent. The current official 0.25° observed precipitation dataset of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) is deterministic and based on Shephard’s interpolation technique. To address these challenges, we have developed the Indian Precipitation Ensemble Dataset (IPED) leveraging the largest network of precipitation gauge stations across India and using a locally weighted spatial regression approach. IPED is a daily 30-member ensemble precipitation product available at 0.1° and 0.25° resolution (1991–2020), accounting for topographical variation in elevation, slope, and aspect. For all thresholds, including the extreme 99<sup>th</sup> percentile precipitation during monsoon, the developed ensemble product exhibits higher discrimination and reliability. This is the first observation-based ensemble precipitation product over India and is expected to have widespread hydrometeorological applications.,Scientific Data

Current precipitation products for the TP often lack sufficient spatial or temporal resolution, hindering accurate characterization and mitigation of precipitation-related hazards. Here, we carry out 10-year (2012–2021, June to September) convection-permitting model simulations based on the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model over the TP. We adopt four one-way nested domains, with the innermost domain providing a 1-km, hourly resolution over the southeastern TP. Model performance is enhanced using a spectral nudging scheme. Our simulated precipitation data are compared against in-situ rain gauge observations and state-of-the-art gridded precipitation products (i.e., HAR v2, ERA5-Land, and IMERG) over the  southeastern TP. Our precipitation dataset demonstrates superior accuracy in mean absolute error, root mean square error, and bias, compared to the other three products. It effectively captures the key feature of the diurnal precipitation cycle and the non-monotonic dependence of precipitation on complex topography over the southeastern TP.,Scientific Data

Extreme drought-heatwave events threaten the biodiversity and stability of aquatic plankton communities in the Yangtze River ecosystems,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02143-1,2025-03-01,Rivers are crucial to biogeochemical cycles, connecting terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric systems. However, their ecosystems are increasingly threatened by extreme weather events. Here we used the environmental DNA approach to assess the impact of extreme drought-heatwave events on the aquatic plankton communities of the Yangtze River. We showed that an extreme drought-heatwave event reduced the α diversity of communities, increased their β diversity, and simultaneously simplified and destabilized community network structure. This event also shifted the dominant algae taxa from Bacillariophyta to Cyanobacteria, accompanied by increases in organic carbon and labile organic carbon contents. Globally, temperature rises during this extreme drought-heatwave event are more pronounced in high-latitude regions, likely amplifying impacts on river ecosystem biodiversity and stability. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of river ecosystems to extreme events and underscore the need to mitigate climate change’s effects on river ecosystems.,Communications Earth & Environment

The point validation between simulated and observed snow depth across control points shows the accuracy of the dataset in simulating the normal and relatively high snow conditions, respectively. Additionally, satellite snow cover maps have been compared with simulated snow depth maps, as a function of elevation and aspect. 2D Validation shows accurate values over time and space, expressed in terms of snowline along the cardinal directions.,Scientific Data

However, their ecosystems are increasingly threatened by extreme weather events. Here we used the environmental DNA approach to assess the impact of extreme drought-heatwave events on the aquatic plankton communities of the Yangtze River. We showed that an extreme drought-heatwave event reduced the α diversity of communities, increased their β diversity, and simultaneously simplified and destabilized community network structure. This event also shifted the dominant algae taxa from Bacillariophyta to Cyanobacteria, accompanied by increases in organic carbon and labile organic carbon contents. Globally, temperature rises during this extreme drought-heatwave event are more pronounced in high-latitude regions, likely amplifying impacts on river ecosystem biodiversity and stability. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of river ecosystems to extreme events and underscore the need to mitigate climate change’s effects on river ecosystems.,Communications Earth & Environment
30-years (1991-2021) Snow Water Equivalent Dataset in the Po River District, Italy,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04633-5,2025-03-04,This paper presents a long-term snow water equivalent dataset in the Po River District, Italy, spanning from 1991 to 2021 at daily time step and 500 m spatial resolution partially covering the mountain ranges of Alps and Apennines. The data has been generated using a hybrid modelling approach integrating the hydrological modelling conducted with the physically-based GEOtop model, preprocessing of the meteorological data, and assimilation of in-situ snow measurements and Earth Observation snow products to enhance the quality of the model estimates. A rigorous quality assessment of the dataset has been performed at different control points selected based on reliability, quality, and territorial distribution. The point validation between simulated and observed snow depth across control points shows the accuracy of the dataset in simulating the normal and relatively high snow conditions, respectively. Additionally, satellite snow cover maps have been compared with simulated snow depth maps, as a function of elevation and aspect. 2D Validation shows accurate values over time and space, expressed in terms of snowline along the cardinal directions.,Scientific Data
Impact of Amazonian deforestation on precipitation reverses between seasons,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08570-y,2025-03-05,Tropical deforestation was found to cause large reductions in precipitation using a range of observation-based datasets<sup>1</sup>. However, the limitations of satellite-based space-for-time statistical analysis have hindered understanding of the roles of reshaped mesoscale atmospheric circulation and regional precipitation recycling at different scales. These effects are considered nonlocal effects, which are distinct from the local effects governed by deforestation-induced reductions in evapotranspiration (ET). Here we show reversed precipitation responses to Amazon deforestation across wet and dry seasons. During the wet season, deforested grids experienced a noteworthy increase in precipitation (0.96 mm month<sup>−1</sup> per percentage point forest loss), primarily attributed to enhanced mesoscale atmospheric circulation (that is, nonlocal effect). These nonlocal increases weaken with distance from deforested grids, leading to significant precipitation reductions in buffers beyond 60 km. Conversely, during the dry season, precipitation decreases in deforested grids and throughout all analysis buffers, with local effects from reduced ET dominating. Our findings highlight the intricate balance between local effects and nonlocal effects in driving deforestation–precipitation responses across different seasons and scales and emphasize the urgent need to address the rapid and extensive loss of forest in the Amazon region.,Nature
Discrete fracture network modelling reconstructs fracture array evolution and related petrophysical properties over geological time,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02146-y,2025-03-05,Fractured rock petrophysical studies rarely use temporal constraints, thus hindering fracture-related permeability and connectivity estimation during past geofluid migration. Here we present a conceptual approach, using a stochastic method incorporating absolute ages to reconstruct fracture arrays back in geological time. Generating ‘grown’ discrete fracture network models, we simulate the hydraulic behaviour of fractured rock volumes from the late-Cretaceous/Palaeocene to the Devonian, via progressive fracture back-stripping. We reveal that for the examined rock mass, maximum principal permeability increased through time from 9.47e-14 m<sup>2</sup> to 4.44e-13 m<sup>2</sup> (~3 orders of magnitude) along with the maximum horizontal permeability orientation shifting from NE-SW to NW-SE. Similarly, the connectivity metric increased with fracture saturation, peaking in the mid-Cretaceous. For comparison, dated offshore hydrocarbon secondary migration potentially coincides with our results. Back-stripping of time-constrained fracture sets is therefore a powerful method to investigate and quantify the dynamic evolution of petrophysical properties through geological time.,Communications Earth & Environment
An annotated Dataset and Benchmark for Detecting Floating Debris in Inland Waters,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04594-9,2025-03-05,Marine litter is a serious threat to marine ecosystems, and the timely removal of floating waste from inland waters is effective in preventing floating debris from entering the sea. An accurate object detection system is a prerequisite for efficiently clearing floaters. However, complex light conditions in the water, small size objects and other factors pose a huge challenge for floating object detection. In order to facilitate the solution of the floating object pollution problem and promote the application of AI technology in the water industry, we proposed the first floater dataset of waters collected from real water scenarios based on shore-based filming equipment, IWHR_AI_Lable_Floater_V1. The dataset consists of 3000 images containing accurate annotation information to support vision-based water surface floater detection tasks. We conducted a number of baseline experiments to evaluate the performance of mainstream object detection algorithms on this dataset. The results show that the detection accuracies of the models, including the state-of-the-art model YOLOv9, are all low, which also indicates that floating object detection is a challenging task.,Scientific Data
Divergent response of aridity index to historical land use and land cover change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00978-1,2025-03-05,By using model simulations, we show that historical land use and land cover change since 1850 has impacted aridity index (AI) worldwide, causing divergent responses in different regions. Locally, AI tends to increase (getting humid) in reforestation regions and most humid regions. Owing to these changes, the area of the humid zone expanded insignificantly by 0.22% of the global land area at the expense of drylands.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
A Comprehensive Dataset of Surface Water Quality Spanning 1940-2023 for Empirical and ML Adopted Research,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04715-4,2025-03-06,Assessment and monitoring of surface water quality are essential for food security, public health, and ecosystem protection. Although water quality monitoring is a known phenomenon, little effort has been made to offer a comprehensive and harmonized dataset for surface water at the global scale. This study presents a comprehensive surface water quality dataset that preserves spatio-temporal variability, integrity, consistency, and depth of the data to facilitate empirical and data-driven evaluation, prediction, and forecasting. The dataset is assembled from a range of sources, including regional and global water quality databases, water management organizations, and individual research projects from five prominent countries in the world, e.g., the USA, Canada, Ireland, England, and China. The resulting dataset consists of 2.82 million measurements of eight water quality parameters that span 1940 - 2023. This dataset can support meta-analysis of water quality models and can facilitate Machine Learning (ML) based data and model-driven investigation of the spatial and temporal drivers and patterns of surface water quality at a cross-regional to global scale.,Scientific Data
Bedmap3 updated ice bed, surface and thickness gridded datasets for Antarctica,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04672-y,2025-03-10,We present Bedmap3, the latest suite of gridded products describing surface elevation, ice-thickness and the seafloor and subglacial bed elevation of the Antarctic south of 60 °S. Bedmap3 incorporates and adds to all post-1950s datasets previously used for Bedmap2, including 84 new aero-geophysical surveys by 15 data providers, an additional 52 million data points and 1.9 million line-kilometres of measurement. These efforts have filled notable gaps including in major mountain ranges and the deep interior of East Antarctica, along West Antarctic coastlines and on the Antarctic Peninsula. Our new Bedmap3/RINGS grounding line similarly consolidates multiple recent mappings into a single, spatially coherent feature. Combined with updated maps of surface topography, ice shelf thickness, rock outcrops and bathymetry, Bedmap3 reveals in much greater detail the subglacial landscape and distribution of Antarctica’s ice, providing new opportunities to interpret continental-scale landscape evolution and to model the past and future evolution of the Antarctic ice sheets.,Scientific Data
GLEAM4: global land evaporation and soil moisture dataset at 0.1 resolution from 1980 to near present,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04610-y,2025-03-10,Terrestrial evaporation plays a crucial role in modulating climate and water resources. Here, we present a continuous, daily dataset covering 1980–2023 with a 0.1°spatial resolution, produced using the fourth generation of the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM). GLEAM4 embraces developments in hybrid modelling, learning evaporative stress from eddy-covariance and sapflow data. It features improved representation of key factors such as interception, atmospheric water demand, soil moisture, and plant access to groundwater. Estimates are inter-compared with existing global evaporation products and validated against in situ measurements, including data from 473 eddy-covariance sites, showing a median correlation of 0.73, root-mean-square error of 0.95 mm d<sup>−1</sup>, and Kling–Gupta efficiency of 0.49. Global land evaporation is estimated at 68.5 × 10<sup>3</sup> km<sup>3</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>, with 62% attributed to transpiration. Beyond actual evaporation and its components (transpiration, interception loss, soil evaporation, etc.), the dataset also provides soil moisture, potential evaporation, sensible heat flux, and evaporative stress, facilitating a wide range of hydrological, climatic, and ecological studies.,Scientific Data
A kinematic analysis of extratropical cyclones, warm conveyor belts and atmospheric rivers,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00942-z,2025-03-10,Mid-latitude weather systems play a significant role in causing floods, wind damage, and related societal impacts. Advances in numerical modeling and observational methods have led to the development of numerous conceptual models in mid-latitude synoptic and dynamical research. As these models proliferate, integrating new insights into a cohesive understanding can be challenging. This paper uses a kinematic perspective to interpret mid-latitude research in a way that synthesises various concepts and create a schematic diagram of an atmospheric river lifecycle. Our analysis demonstrates that, despite varying methods, definitions, and terminology used to describe extratropical cyclones, warm conveyor belt airflows, and atmospheric rivers, the underlying mechanisms driving their formation and development are consistent. Thus, while studying these features independently is valuable, it is important to recognise that they are all part of a larger atmospheric flow pattern. We hope this kinematic approach will serve as a bridge to link research on these phenomena.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science

FloodCastBench: A Large-Scale Dataset and Foundation Models for Flood Modeling and Forecasting,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04725-2,2025-03-12,Effective flood forecasting is crucial for informed decision-making and emergency response. Existing flood datasets mainly describe flood events but lack dynamic process data suitable for machine learning (ML). This work introduces the FloodCastBench dataset, designed for ML-based flood modeling and forecasting, featuring four major flood events: Pakistan 2022, UK 2015, Australia 2022, and Mozambique 2019. FloodCastBench details the process of flood dynamics data acquisition, starting with input data preparation (e.g., topography, land use, rainfall) and flood measurement data collection (e.g., SAR-based maps, surveyed outlines) for hydrodynamic modeling. We deploy a widely recognized finite difference numerical solution to construct high-resolution spatiotemporal dynamic processes with 30-m spatial and 300-second temporal resolutions. Flood measurement data are used to calibrate the hydrodynamic model parameters and validate the flood inundation maps. FloodCastBench provides comprehensive low-fidelity and high-fidelity flood forecasting datasets specifically for ML. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark of foundational models for neural flood forecasting using FloodCastBench, validating its effectiveness in supporting ML models for spatiotemporal, cross-regional, and downscaled flood forecasting.,Scientific Data
Increasing hourly heavy rainfall in Austria reflected in flood changes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08647-2,2025-03-12,Climate change is expected to increase heavy rainfall with concomitant increases in flooding<sup>1</sup>. Causes of increased heavy rainfall include the higher water-holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere and changes in atmospheric circulation patterns<sup>2</sup>, which may translate into future heavy rainfall increases in most of Europe<sup>3</sup>. However, gathering evidence on the time evolution of past changes has been hampered by data limitations and measurement uncertainties, in particular for short rainfall durations, such as 1 h. Here we show an 8% increase in daily and 15% increase in hourly heavy rainfall over the last four decades by analysing a new dataset comprising 883 stations in Austria from 1900 to 2023. These increases are fully consistent between two independent networks and occurred after a retarding phase between 1960 and 1980. Hourly heavy rainfall changes are aligned with temperature increases with the sensitivity of a 7% increase per 1 °C of warming, in line with Clausius–Clapeyron scaling. Daily heavy rainfall changes, however, are aligned with atmospheric circulation indices with little correlation to air temperature, which suggests a bigger role of atmospheric circulation modes than previously thought. The daily heavy rainfall changes are remarkably consistent with observed flood increases of about 8% in large catchments. The hourly heavy rainfall changes are similarly consistent with flood changes in small catchments, although the flood increase is stronger (25% over the last four decades). Climate adaptation measures in flood management may therefore be more pressing for rivers draining smaller catchment areas than for large rivers.,Nature

Based on the trilinear graph of S<sub>y</sub> and soil textures, we develop a comprehensive global dataset of gridded average specific yield (GASY) aimed for various soil textures, which are obtained from the Global Soil Dataset for Earth System Models, the SoilGrids product, and the Harmonized World Soil Database. Validations with existing S<sub>y</sub> values estimated by laboratory and field methods across different S<sub>y</sub> concepts, at the aquifer-scale to global-scale, compellingly revealed that the GASY effectively represents reliable average S<sub>y</sub> for each soil texture. The depth limitation (~2 m) of GASY is attributed to the depth limitations of soil texture data, and readers can expand the GASY into deeper soils by reasonably assuming a vertical variation of soil texture with depth. The GASY holds great benefits for future modeling of groundwater dynamics and understanding the groundwater resources distribution and mitigation of climate change impacts.,Scientific Data
Enhancing sub-seasonal soil moisture forecasts through land initialization,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00987-0,2025-03-12,We assess the relative contributions of land, atmosphere, and oceanic initializations to the forecast skill of root zone soil moisture (SM) utilizing the Community Earth System Model version 2 Sub to Seasonal climate forecast experiments (CESM2-S2S). Using eight sensitivity experiments, we disentangle the individual impacts of these three components and their interactions on the forecast skill for the contiguous United States. The CESM2-S2S experiment, in which land states are initialized while atmosphere and ocean remain in their climatological states, contributes 91 ± 3% of the total sub-seasonal forecast skill across varying soil moisture conditions during summer and winter. Most SM predictability stems from the soil moisture memory effect. Additionally, land-atmosphere coupling contributes 50% of the land-driven soil moisture predictability. A comparative analysis of the CESM2-S2S SM forecast skills against two other climate models highlights the potential for enhancing soil moisture forecast accuracy by improving the representation of soil moisture-precipitation feedback.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Groundwater quality evolution across China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57853-z,2025-03-14,China is facing a severe groundwater quality crisis amid economic development and climate change, yet the extent and trajectory of this crisis remain largely unknown. Here we developed a machine-learning model, incorporating natural and social-economic factors, to construct annual probabilistic maps of poor groundwater quality (PGQ, i.e., Class V based on the Chinese groundwater quality standard) across China from 1980 to 2100. Alarmingly, our findings indicate a concerning escalation in PGQ area ratio, rising from 17.3% in 1980 to 30.1% in 2000, and surging to 40.8% by 2020, adversely affecting 6.8%, 17.5%, and 36.0% of the Chinese population, respectively. The predominant drivers of this degradation were identified as agricultural discharge (contributing to 10.7% growth in PGQ area ratio), followed by groundwater exploitation (5.6%), industrial discharge (5.3%), domestic discharge (1.7%), climate change (0.5%), and land use change (-0.3%). By 2050, the PGQ area ratio could range from 37.9% to 48.3% under different socio-economic and climate scenarios. Our study highlights the urgent need for effective water resources management and conservation measures to mitigate the deteriorating trend of groundwater quality and address the challenges posed by socio-economic development and climate change, thereby safeguarding water security for China and the global community.,Nature Communications
Speleothem evidence of solar modulation on the south Asia monsoon intensity,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00971-8,2025-03-15,The influence of solar variation on climate has long been debated. Here, we utilize a decadal-resolved speleothem δ<sup>18</sup>O record from Vietnam, spanning 32.5 to 27.5 kyr BP, as a proxy for regional precipitation levels. Our results show a general coherence between Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) and regional precipitation, supporting a positive climate response consistent with conventional monsoon theory. Spectral analysis on studied datasets reveals an approximately 180-year periodicity coinciding with the de Vries cycle of solar activity. Further comparing our record with 35 other speleothem records, we demonstrate the importance of sufficient age control points in capturing solar-related periodicities. Model simulation shows that TSI could enhance monsoonal circulation and regional precipitation. Also highlighted are the implications of chronology control for detecting climate events in proxy records. The new findings underscore the significance of relatively minor radiative forcing in regional climate dynamics over monsoonal Asia on decadal to centennial timescales.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Ecological restoration in the Yellow River Basin enhances hydropower potential,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57891-7,2025-03-15,Hydropower, an important renewable energy source worldwide, is threatened by reservoir sedimentation. Ecological restoration (ER) can mitigate this by reducing upstream sediment, thereby extending hydropower facilities’ lifespan. However, ER may also reduce runoff, potentially diminishing energy generation and complicating its overall impact on hydropower potential. Here, we examine China’s Yellow River, once the world’s most sediment-laden river, using eco-hydrological and reservoir regulation models to assess how large-scale ER influences the hydropower potential of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir, which controls 92.3% of the basin area. Our results indicate that, excluding upstream reservoirs’ operations and socioeconomic water use, Xiaolangdi could generate a total of ~2.7×10<sup>11</sup> kWh of energy before facing diminished flexibility and efficiency caused by the exhaustion of sediment storage—57.3% more than without ER—equating to an additional ~100 billion kWh. This enhancement in hydropower potential primarily arises from the extended lifespan, despite a 6.9% reduction in average annual energy generation. These findings advance our understanding of the ecosystem-water-sediment-energy nexus, offering valuable insights for integrated watershed management globally.,Nature Communications
Shifting influences of Indian Ocean Dipole and western Pacific subtropical high on annual precipitation δ18O in southern East Asia,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01000-4,2025-03-17,Clarifying relationships between stable oxygen isotope ratios in precipitation (δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub>) and atmospheric circulations including the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) forms the basis of paleocirculation reconstructions. However, whether the IOD and WPSH modulate interannual variations of δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> remains unclear. Here, we reveal the links between the IOD/WPSH and the annual δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> in southern East Asia. We found that the IOD strongly influenced annual δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> before 1999 by changes in moisture supply from different transport pathways and convection. However, the link became decoupled after 1999, resulting from the transition of the IOD from a symmetric to an asymmetric pattern. In contrast, significantly enhanced WPSH emerges as an important influence on annual δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> after 1999. Therefore, the IOD and WPSH alternately influence interannual variation of δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> around 1999. Our findings imply that signals of IOD and WPSH should be considered in different periods to better interpret paleoclimate records.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Decreasing dynamic predictability of global agricultural drought with warming climate,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-025-02289-y,2025-03-17,Droughts have been occurring frequently worldwide in a warming climate with an adverse impact on water–food–energy–ecology security, which raises substantial challenges for drought predictability. However, little is known about the future changes in dynamic predictability of agricultural drought over the globe and the dominant confounders causing this change. Here we leveraged Bayesian model averaging ensemble vine copula model to reveal changes in agricultural drought predictability globally in warm seasons at three projected global warming levels. We found that the projected dynamic predictability of agricultural drought would significantly decrease over 70% of the global land areas in +2 °C and +3 °C worlds, especially over North America, Amazonia, Europe, eastern and southern Asia and Australia. This was primarily attributed to the weakening soil moisture memory, background aridity and weakening land–atmosphere coupling. Our findings highlight that stakeholders should employ dynamic climate adaptations to cope with the decreasing drought predictability in a warmer climate.,Nature Climate Change
Physical and biogeochemical responses of Tibetan Plateau lakes to climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-025-00650-5,2025-03-18,The lakes, rivers and glaciers of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) — a vital water resource for East Asia — are undergoing substantial environmental change. In this Review, we examine trends in the size and the physical and biogeochemical properties of TP lakes. Lake area and volume have consistently increased since 1995, with most rapid expansion in northern lakes. Between 1986 and 2022, the total area of lakes larger than 1 km<sup>2</sup> increased from 37,109 km<sup>2</sup> to 46,980 km<sup>2</sup>, and water storage increased by 169.7 km<sup>3</sup>, driven by warming and enhanced precipitation. In large lakes (≥10 km<sup>2</sup>), average surface temperatures increased by 1.33 °C, water transparency increased by 1 m, and salinity decreased from 48.76 to 23.76 psu. Responses in lake biogeochemistry include enhanced microbial diversity and trophic status, despite minimal additional nutrient inputs and consistent rates of productivity. Although TP lakes appear to be a net source of CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere (1.60, 6.87 and 1.16 Tg C yr<sup>−1</sup> in the 2000s, 2010s and the 2020s, respectively), long-term CO<sub>2</sub> source-sink dynamics remain uncertain. TP lake area is projected to increase by 9,000 km<sup>2</sup> by 2050 under SSP5-8.5 and will continue to influence and enhance regional precipitation. Improved prediction of TP lake hydrology and biogeochemistry will aid sustainable management of water resources across the TP.,Nature Reviews Earth & Environment
A spatially constrained remote sensing-based inventory of glacial lakes worldwide,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04809-z,2025-03-20,Climate change accelerates the extensive retreat of glaciers, leading to the widespread development of glacial lakes. A holistic picture of the spatial distribution of glacial lakes worldwide is a critical base for tracking the outburst hazards. By employing a semi-automated mapping approach and rigorous quality control, this study inventories 117,352 glacial lakes (≥0.01 km<sup>2</sup>) worldwide (the ice cap/sheet of Antarctic and Greenland excluded), with a net area of 24,755.84 ± 2,971.33 km<sup>2</sup>. The evaluation result shows this global inventory of glacial lakes (GIGLak) has an overall accuracy of 89.37% and 91.42% in number and area, respectively. These glacial lakes are widely distributed in different altitudes, ranging from the Earth’s third pole to the coasts. Most glacial lakes are distributed in the Greenland periphery, High-Mountain Asia, Alaska, Canada, and the Cordilleras. The number of glacial lakes between 0.01–0.1 km<sup>2</sup> accounts for 77.24% of the total count but only 11.82% in area. The classification of glacial lakes as four types indicates that the ice-uncontacted proglacial lakes dominate the number (67.07%) and area (53.04%) worldwide.,Scientific Data
Seasonal velocity patterns provide insights for the soft-bed subglacial hydrology continuum,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02198-0,2025-03-21,Subglacial hydrology plays an important role in controlling glacier behaviour, influencing glacier retreat and the resulting contributions to sea level rise. Here we present a detailed seasonal data set from four soft-bedded temperate glaciers and demonstrate a continuum of subglacial hydrology from channelized to a multichannel distributed behaviour. Our results illustrate how this continuum may be affected by till grain size and subaqueous processes, and we quantify the relative timings of basal sliding and deformation. These different hydrologies have a distinctive seasonal velocity pattern, which although have been identified using a multi-data stream, we suggest can be classified using solely Sentinel-1 satellite-based glacier velocity data. The ability to categorize subglacial glacier hydrology over a much larger data set would allow a better parameterization of subglacial processes for ice sheet models.,Communications Earth & Environment
An interpretable machine learning model for seasonal precipitation forecasting,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02207-2,2025-03-21,Seasonal climate forecasting is important for societal welfare, as it supports decision-makers in taking proactive steps to mitigate risks from adverse climate conditions or to take advantage of favorable ones. Here, we introduce TelNet, a sequence-to-sequence machine learning model for short-to-medium lead seasonal precipitation forecasting. The model takes past seasonal precipitation values and climate indices to predict an empirical precipitation distribution for every grid point of the target region for the next six overlapping seasons. TelNet has a simple encoder-decoder-head architecture, allowing the model to be trained with a limited amount of data, as is often the case in climate forecasting. Its deterministic and probabilistic performance is thoroughly evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art dynamical and deep learning models in a prominent region for seasonal forecasting studies due to its high climate predictability. The training, validation, and test sets are resampled multiple times to estimate the uncertainty associated with a small dataset. The results show that TelNet ranks among the most accurate and calibrated models across multiple initialization months and lead times, especially during the rainy season when the predictable signal is strongest. Moreover, the model allows instance- and lead-wise forecast interpretation through its variable selection weights.,Communications Earth & Environment
Prolonged water body types dataset of urban agglomeration in central China from 1990 to 2021,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04794-3,2025-03-22,Data and knowledge of spatial-temporal dynamics of multiple types of water body are significant for water resources management but remain very limited. Using the Landsat satellite data and weakly supervised deep learning techniques for long term mapping, we report annual maps of multiple types of inland water bodies on urban agglomeration scale in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (MRYR) during 1990-2021 at 30m spatial resolution. Accuracy assessment from 14000 validation points in seven years indicates an overall accuracy of 94.50%. Quantitative and qualitative comparison with other water related mapping products further demonstrates the superiority on long time span, refined classification system, and the high precision. The Water-MRYR could support the government and the public in the challenging water resources management and wetland conservation.,Scientific Data
100-m-resolution surface soil moisture data during the thawing season on the Qinghai‒Tibet Plateau,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04831-1,2025-03-24,The characteristics of the spatial distribution of surface soil moisture (SM) on the Qinghai‒Tibet Plateau (QTP) on a fine scale are unclear due to the lack of high-spatial-resolution SM datasets. To improve this situation, we first supplemented 659 SM datasets in areas on the QTP containing sparse monitoring stations from 2021–2022 and integrated published SM datasets. Based on Sentinel-1&amp;2 and measured SM data, we developed an SM retrieval algorithm for the ascending and descending orbits. Then, 100-m-resolution SM spatial data were generated for the thawing season of 2017–2023 in the SAR signal-applicable area on the QTP. As validated by the measured data, the correlation coefficients of the retrieval results for the ascending and descending orbits were 0.72 and 0.69, respectively, and the bias reached 0.07 m³/m³ and an RMSE of 0.07 m³/m³ for both. These SM datasets exhibit notable promise for improving our understanding and analysis of the ecology and hydrology of different environments on the QTP.,Scientific Data
Machine learning shows a limit to rain-snow partitioning accuracy when using near-surface meteorology,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58234-2,2025-03-25,Partitioning precipitation into rain and snow with near-surface meteorology is a well-known challenge. However, whether a limit exists to its potential performance remains unknown. Here, we evaluate this possibility by applying a set of benchmark precipitation phase partitioning methods plus three machine learning (ML) models (an artificial neural network, random forest, and XGBoost) to two independent datasets: 38.5 thousand crowdsourced observations and 17.8 million synoptic meteorology reports. The ML methods provide negligible improvements over the best benchmarks, increasing accuracy only by up to 0.6% and reducing rain and snow biases by up to -4.7%. ML methods fail to identify mixed precipitation and sub-freezing rainfall events, while expressing their worst accuracy values from 1.0 °C–2.5 °C. A potential cause of these shortcomings is the air temperature overlap in rain and snow distributions (peaking between 1.0 °C–1.6 °C), which expresses a significant negative relationship (p &lt; 0.0005) with partitioning accuracy. Thus, the meteorological characteristics of rain and snow are similar at air temperatures slightly above freezing with increasing overlap associated with decreasing performance. We suggest researchers switch their focus from marginally improving inherently limited precipitation phase partitioning methods using near-surface meteorology to creating new methods that assimilate novel data sources—e.g., crowdsourced precipitation phase observations.,Nature Communications
Freshwater inflows to closed basins of the Andean plateau in Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02130-6,2025-03-26,More than half the world’s lithium resources are found in brine aquifers in Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia. Lithium brine processing requires freshwater, so as lithium exploration increases, accurate estimates of freshwater availability are critical for water management decisions in this region with limited water resources. Here we calculate modern freshwater inflows, such as groundwater recharge and streamflow, for 28 active or prospective lithium-producing basins. We use regional water budget assessments, field streamflow measurements, and global climate and groundwater recharge datasets. Using the freshwater inflow estimates, we calculate water scarcity using the Available Water Remaining methodology. Among all 28 basins, freshwater inflows range from 2 to 33 mm year<sup>−1</sup>. Our results reveal that commonly used global hydrologic models overestimate streamflow and freshwater availability substantially, leading to inaccurate water scarcity classifications.,Communications Earth & Environment
A pronounced decline in northern vegetation resistance to flash droughts from 2001 to 2022,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58253-z,2025-03-27,Climate change has led to the transition of droughts into rapid and intensified phenomena known as flash droughts, presenting considerable challenges for risk management, particularly concerning their impact on ecosystem productivity. Quantifying the ecosystem’s capacity to maintain productivity during flash droughts, referred to as ecosystem resistance, is crucial to assess drought impacts. However, it remains uncertain how the resistance of ecosystem productivity to flash drought changes over time. Here we show that vegetation resistance to flash droughts declines by up to 27% (±5%) over the Northern Hemisphere hotspots during 2001-2022, including eastern Asia, western North America, and northern Europe. The notable decline in vegetation resistance is mainly attributed to increased vapour pressure deficit and temperature, and enhanced vegetation structural sensitivity to water availability. Flash droughts pose higher ecological risks than slowly-developing droughts during the growing seasons, where ecosystem productivity experiences faster decline rates with a shorter response time. Our results underscore the limited ecosystem capacity to resist flash droughts under climate change.,Nature Communications
Dynamics of intensification of extreme precipitation events over the Arabian Peninsula derived from CMIP6 simulations,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01016-w,2025-03-28,This study derives historical and future changes in extreme precipitation events (EPEs) across the Arabian Peninsula (AP) using data from CMIP6 models. Both the frequency and intensity of EPEs are lower in historical CMIP6 data compared to observations. Despite this bias, CMIP6 models offer valuable insights into future climate projections. Across all emission-scenarios, significant increases in EPEs frequency and intensity are expected over the AP. Under the high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5), some regions may experience a doubling of EPEs by the end-of-the-21st-century. This rise is attributed to several climate change-driven factors, including the southward-shift and intensification of subtropical-westerly-jet, increased transient activity, enhanced dynamical lifting, and increased moisture transport from nearby seas. These factors suggest a future atmosphere that will be more dynamic and moisture-rich than today. While these CMIP6 insights are crucial for guiding adaptation and mitigation strategies, enhanced EPE modeling is essential for precise decision-making amid rising future risks.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Interdecadal variability of terrestrial water storage since 2003,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02203-6,2025-03-29,Earth’s water cycle is changing due to anthropogenic forcing and internal variations in the climate system. These changes are leading to an intensification of the water cycle that manifests as more frequent and stronger droughts in some areas, and pluvials in others. The resulting impacts on terrestrial water storage can be crucial for water availability. However, current understanding is hampered by limitations in observations and models, and the variety of processes that influence terrestrial water storage across temporal scales. Here, we leverage the now two-decades long satellite record from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment and subsequent Follow-On missions to investigate persistent trends in the presence of internal variability. We use cyclostationary empirical orthogonal function analysis to uncover statistical modes of variability that help explain a shift in decadal terrestrial water storage trends that occurred around 2012. The dominant statistical mode suggests an interdecadal periodicity that is also found in the precipitation record. The second leading mode is highly correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Isolating these modes points to regions where the magnitude of the terrestrial water storage trend may flatten or reverse in coming decades due to internal climate variability and reduces uncertainty in multidecadal linear trends.,Communications Earth & Environment
Divergent effects of temperature and precipitation on water flow into the largest lake on the Tibetan Plateau,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01017-9,2025-03-30,The majority of lakes on the TP have expanded in an accelerated manner, changing the regulation of local water cycles and ecosystems. Here, spatiotemporal changes in inflow to Selin Co (the largest lake on the TP) from 1979 to 2022 were modeled, and the impacts of warming and wetting on water volume were explored. The modeled annual mean lake inflow was 2.27 km<sup>3</sup>, accompanied by a significant growth trend of 0.035 km<sup>3</sup>/yr (p &lt; 0.01, the contributions of warming and wetting are −0.016 and 0.048 km<sup>3</sup>/yr respectively). Warming (+0.0386 K/yr) caused a decrease of 0.33 km<sup>3</sup> in lake inflow per year, accounting for 14.5% of the annual mean water volume, while wetting (+4.46 mm/yr) caused an increase of 0.91 km<sup>3</sup> in lake inflow per year, accounting for 40% of the annual mean value. These divergent effects of increasing temperature and precipitation on lake inflow makes it more difficult to predict the future water resources of basins such as Selin Co.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Global patterns in observed hydrologic processes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-025-00407-w,2025-03-31,To manage water resources and forecast river flows, hydrologists seek to understand how water moves from precipitation, through watersheds, into river channels. However, we lack fundamental information on the spatial distribution and physical controls on global hydrologic processes. This information is needed to provide theoretical support for large-domain model simulations. Here, to address this issue, we present a global, searchable database of 400 research watersheds with published descriptions of dominant hydrologic flow pathways. This knowledge synthesis approach leverages decades of grant funding, fieldwork effort and local expertise. We use the database to test longstanding hypotheses about the roles of climate, biomes and landforms in controlling hydrologic processes. We show that aridity predicts the depth of water flow pathways and that terrain and biomes predict the prevalence of lateral flow pathways. These new data and search capabilities support efficient hypothesis testing to investigate emergent patterns that relate landscape organization to hydrologic function.,Nature Water
A unified ensemble soil moisture dataset across the continental United States,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04657-x,2025-04-01,A unified ensemble soil moisture (SM) package has been developed over the Continental United States (CONUS). The data package includes 19 products from land surface models, remote sensing, reanalysis, and machine learning models. All datasets are unified to a 0.25-degree and monthly spatiotemporal resolution, providing a comprehensive view of surface SM dynamics. The statistical analysis of the datasets leverages the Koppen-Geiger Climate Classification to explore surface SM’s spatiotemporal variabilities. The extracted SM characteristics highlight distinct patterns, with the western CONUS showing larger coefficient of variation values and the eastern CONUS exhibiting higher SM values. Remote sensing datasets tend to be drier, while reanalysis products present wetter conditions. In-situ SM observations serve as the basis for wavelet power spectrum analyses to explain discrepancies in temporal scales across datasets facilitating daily SM records. This study provides a comprehensive soil moisture data package and an analysis framework that can be used for Earth system model evaluations and uncertainty quantification, quantifying drought impacts and land–atmosphere interactions and making recommendations for drought response planning.,Scientific Data
FAIR-Compliant Database for Soil Erosion Studies: The Marganai Forest Experiment,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04797-0,2025-04-02,The ‘2018 Marganai Forest Soil Erosion Experiment Database’ is a comprehensive collection of measures taken during scientific experiment trials designed to investigate the effects of forest canopy coverage on soil erosion under intense artificial rainfall, four years after coppicing. The investigation involved the establishment of eight paired plots with and without forest canopy coverage, subjected to artificial rainfall simulation aimed to measure the amount of sediment transported by runoff. The work represents a valuable resource for researchers interested in understanding the complex implications of forest management practices on soil erosion. The paper, produced using Quarto in a Gitlab-based RStudio project, is an example of ‘reproducible research’ documenting that the database provides detailed information on the experimental setup as well as on the range of different measurements that have been collected. The database, produced using NFS-DataDocumentationProcedure, is stored in an SQLite file, extensively exploiting the relational properties of the engine, enhancing data accessibility, interoperability and reusability.,Scientific Data
Drivers and impacts of sediment deposition in Amazonian floodplains,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57495-1,2025-04-02,The Amazon River carries enormous amounts of sediment from the Andes mountains, much of which is deposited in its floodplains. However, accurate quantification of the sediment sink at fine spatiotemporal scales is still challenging. Here, we present a high-resolution hydrodynamic-sediment model to simulate sediment deposition in a representative Amazon/Solimões floodplain. The process is found to be jointly driven by inundation, suspended sediment concentration in the Amazon River, and floodplain hydrodynamics and only weakly correlated with inundation level. By upscaling the sediment deposition rate (1.33 ± 0.24 kg m<sup>−2</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>), we estimate the trapping of 77.3 ± 13.9 Mt (or 6.1 ± 1%) of the Amazon River sediment by the Amazon/Solimões floodplains every year. Widespread deforestation would reduce the trapping efficiency of the floodplains over time, exacerbating downstream river aggradation. Additionally, we show that the deposition of sediment-associated organic carbon plays a minor role in fueling carbon dioxide and methane emissions in the Amazon.,Nature Communications
Monsoonal imprint on late Quaternary landscapes of the Rub’ al Khali Desert,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02224-1,2025-04-03,Abundant geomorphological, biological, and isotopic records show that Arabia repeatedly underwent significant climate-driven environmental changes during late Quaternary humid periods. Precisely mapping how the enhancement and expansion of the African Monsoon during these humid periods have affected landscape evolution and human occupation dynamics in Arabia remains a scientific challenge. Here we reconstruct an ancient water-sculpted landscape consisting of lake and river deposits, coupled with a large outlet valley in the Rub’ al Khali Desert of Saudi Arabia. During the peak of the Holocene Humid Period or before, intense rainfall reactivated alluvial floodplains and filled a ~1100 km² topographic depression, which eventually breached, carving a deep ~150 km-long valley. Coupling geologic reconstructions with transient Earth system model simulations shows that this hydrological activity was linked to higher seasonal precipitation punctuated by repeated heavy events. Analysis of lacustrine and fluvial sedimentary deposits implies sediment routing across distances of up to 1000 km from the Asir Mountains. Our results indicate that such intense flooding challenges the conventional view of simple, weak, and linear landscape stabilization following increased rainfall in Arabia. Our findings highlight the crucial role of an enhanced African Monsoon in driving rapid landscape transformations in the Arabian Desert.,Communications Earth & Environment
Giant iceberg meltwater increases upper-ocean stratification and vertical mixing,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-025-01659-7,2025-04-04,Ice-sheet mass loss is one of the clearest manifestations of climate change, with Antarctica discharging mass into the ocean via melting or through calving. The latter produces icebergs that can modify ocean water properties, often at great distances from source. This affects upper-ocean physics and primary productivity, with implications for atmospheric carbon drawdown. A detailed understanding of iceberg modification of ocean waters has hitherto been hindered by a lack of proximal measurements. Here unique measurements of a giant iceberg from an underwater glider enable quantification of meltwater effects on the physical and biological processes in the upper layers of the Southern Ocean, a region disproportionately important for global heat and carbon sequestration. Iceberg basal melting erodes seasonally produced winter water layer stratification, normally forming a strong potential energy barrier to vertical exchange of surface and deep waters, while freshwater run-off increases and shoals near-surface stratification. Nutrient-rich deeper waters, incorporating meltwater loaded with terrigenous material, are ventilated to below this stratification maxima, providing a potential mechanism for alleviating critical phytoplankton-limiting components. Regional historical hydrographic data demonstrate similar stratification changes during the passage of another large iceberg, suggesting that they may be an important pathway of aseasonal winter water modification.,Nature Geoscience
High Resolution Water Quality Dataset of Chinese Lakes and Reservoirs from 2000 to 2023,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04915-y,2025-04-04,Water quality parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), total nitrogen (TN, includes both organic nitrogen and inorganic nitrogen), total phosphorus (TP), permanganate index (COD<sub>Mn</sub>), turbidity (Tur), electrical conductivity (EC), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)) are important to evaluate the ecological health of lakes and reservoirs. In this research, we developed a monthly dataset of these key water quality parameters from 2000 to 2023 for nearly 180,000 lakes and reservoirs across China, using the random forest (RF) models. These RF models took into account the impacts of climate, soil properties, and anthropogenic activities within basins of studied lakes and reservoirs, and effectively captured the spatial and temporal variations of their water quality parameters with correlation coefficients (R<sup>2</sup>) ranging from 0.65 to 0.76. Interestingly, an increase in Tur and EC was observed during this period, while pH, DO, and other parameters showed minimal fluctuations. This dataset is of significant value for further evaluating the ecological, environmental, and climatic functions of aquatic ecosystems.,Scientific Data
A 20-year dataset (2001–2020) of global cropland water-use efficiency at 1-km grid resolution,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04904-1,2025-04-04,Cropland water-use efficiency (WUE) is an essential indicator for the sustainable utilization of agricultural water resources. The lack of long-term global cropland WUE datasets with high spatial resolution limits our understanding of global and regional patterns of cropland WUE. This study developed a long-term global cropland WUE dataset at 1-km spatial resolution from 2001 to 2020. The cropland WUE was obtained as the ratio between net primary productivity (NPP) and evapotranspiration that was retrieved from ETMonitor global evapotranspiration datasets. The global cropland NPP was estimated by subtracting plant respiration from gross primary production (GPP), which was estimated using an improved light-use efficiency model after being optimized for different global climate zones using flux-tower observation data. The generated WUE product showed good accuracy with high correlation efficiency (0.76) and low root mean square error (0.5 g C/kg H<sub>2</sub>O/yr) compared with the ground measurements at flux towers. This dataset can be used as fundamental data to advance the efficient utilization of water use for sustainable development.,Scientific Data
Big data show idiosyncratic patterns and rates of geomorphic river mobility,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58427-9,2025-04-05,Big data present unprecedented opportunities to test long-standing theories regarding patterns and rates of geomorphic river adjustments. Here, we use locational probabilities derived from Landsat imagery (1988-2019) to quantify the dynamics of 600 km<sup>2</sup> of riverbed in 10 Philippine catchments. Analysis of lateral adjustments reveals spatially non-uniform variability in along-valley patterns of geomorphic river mobility, with zones of relative stability interspersed with zones of relative instability. Hotspots of mobility vary in magnitude, size and location between catchments. We could not identify monotonic relationships between local factors (active channel width, valley floor width and confinement ratio) and mobility. No relation between the channel pattern type and rates of adjustment was evident. We contend that satellite-derived locational probabilities provide a spatially continuous dynamic metric that can help unravel and contextualise forms and rates of geomorphic river adjustment, thereby helping to derive insights into idiosyncrasies of river behaviour in dynamic landscapes.,Nature Communications
Tracking grid-level freshwater boundary exceedance along global supply chains from consumption to impact,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-025-00420-z,2025-04-07,Consumption behaviours exert pressure on water resources both locally and globally through interconnected supply chains, hindering the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals 6 (Clean water and sanitation) and 12 (Responsible consumption and production). However, it is challenging to link hotspots of water depletion across spatial scales to final consumption while reflecting intersectoral competition for water. In this study, we estimated the global exceedance of regional freshwater boundaries (RFBs) due to human water withdrawal at a 5-arcmin grid scale using 2015 data, enabling the identification of hotspots across different spatial scales. To reduce uncertainty, we used average estimates from 15 global hydrological models and 5 environmental flow requirement methods. We further attributed the hotspots of exceedance to final consumption across 245 economies and 134 sectors via the multi-region input–output model EMERGING. Our refined framework revealed previously unknown connections between regional hotspots and consumption through international trade. Notably, we found that 24% of grid-level RFB exceedance (718 km<sup>3</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>; 95% confidence interval of 659–776 km<sup>3</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>) was outsourced through trade, with the largest flows (52 km<sup>3</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>; 95% confidence interval of 47–56 km<sup>3</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>) from water-stressed South and Central Asia to arid West Asia. The demand for cereals and other agricultural products dominated global consumption-based RFB exceedance (29%), while the exports of textiles and machinery and equipment exacerbated territorial exceedance in manufacturing hubs within emerging economies. Our methodology facilitates the tracing of global hotspots of water scarcity along supply chains and the assignment of responsibilities at finer scales.,Nature Water
Subglacial water amplifies Antarctic contributions to sea-level rise,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58375-4,2025-04-07,Antarctica’s contribution to global sea-level rise is deeply uncertain, with subglacial water suspected to play a critical role, yet its impact remains unclear. We demonstrate that water at the base of ice sheets influences sliding behaviour and that its exclusion from models can underestimate sea-level rise projections and delay the predicted onset of tipping points. Here we use an Antarctic Ice Sheet model (Elmer/Ice) to explore how different assumptions about water pressure at the ice base affect sea-level rise projections from 2015 to 2300. Our results indicate that incorporating subglacial water can amplify ice discharge across the Antarctic Ice Sheet by up to threefold above the standard approach, potentially contributing an additional 2.2 metres to sea-level rise by 2300. Notably, a smoothly decreasing basal drag near the grounding line more than doubles grounding line flux by 2300 relative to scenarios where effective pressure is simplified into a spatially constant coefficient. Basin-specific responses vary significantly, with some scenarios advancing tipping points by up to 40 years. These findings underscore the critical need to integrate evolving subglacial hydrology into ice sheet models.,Nature Communications
A global near real-time dataset of Microwave Integrated Drought Index from the Fengyun-3 satellites,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04935-8,2025-04-07,Droughts have become more frequent and intense with increasing climate warming, posing widespread risks on ecosystem, agricultural, and water resources, therefore effective and timely drought monitoring is critical to drought assessment, management, and mitigation. Here, we presented a global monthly and ten-day drought dataset of the Fengyun-3 Microwave Integrated Drought Index (FY-3 MIDI) by integrating the inconsistency corrected FY-3B/C/D derived microwave precipitation, soil moisture, and land surface temperature with optimal weights from June 2014 to present. The dataset was evaluated and validated against the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, the Self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index, and the non-FY MIDI at 0.25°. The FY-3 MIDI can effectively observe drought condition and characteristics as captured by the reference datasets, and it was reliable in monitoring meteorological drought with the ability to work in all-weather condition. Based on the operational Fengyun-3 series satellite, it provided valuable operational service in near real-time on a monthly and ten-day time scale, guaranteeing present and future continuous applications to support global and regional drought monitoring and assessment.,Scientific Data
Rapid decline of Caspian Sea level threatens ecosystem integrity, biodiversity protection, and human infrastructure,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02212-5,2025-04-10,The Caspian Sea is the world’s largest landlocked waterbody, providing habitat for hundreds of endemic and migratory species, along with ecosystem services that sustain millions of people. Global warming is projected to drive declines in water levels of up to 21 m by 2100. Using geospatial analyses, we assessed the impact of sea level decline on habitats, protected areas, and human infrastructure. We show that a water level decline of just 5–10 m will critically disrupt key ecosystems (including habitats for endemic Caspian seals and sturgeon), reduce existing marine protected area coverage by up to 94%, and render billions of dollars of civil and industrial infrastructure obsolete. Replacing traditional static conservation planning with a pre-emptive, dynamic approach that allows protected areas to track shifting ecosystems, is recommended to help endemic Caspian Sea biodiversity adapt to these changes, and to avoid conflicts with mitigation efforts directed at protecting human activities.,Communications Earth & Environment
Observational evidence of increased afternoon rainfall downwind of irrigated areas,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58729-y,2025-04-10,Irrigation plays a vital role in addressing the growing food demand of an increasing global population. It represents one of the most critical and direct human interventions on the coupled water and energy cycles. As irrigated farmland continues to expand, understanding the climate impact of extensive irrigation becomes increasingly important. Yet, the effect on rainfall patterns near irrigated areas remains unclear. Here, using two global, high-resolution, sub-daily precipitation datasets, we show that afternoon rain events occur more often 10 km to 50 km downwind and less often upwind of extensively irrigated land. However, we also find that the total amount of heavy afternoon rain downwind of irrigated areas is lower than upwind. Our results establish large-scale observational evidence of the local precipitation dynamics surrounding irrigated areas; these insights will help constrain the representation of these processes in next-generation climate and weather forecasting models and provide valuable insights for regional water management.,Nature Communications
Subsurface heatwaves in lakes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-025-02314-0,2025-04-10,Lake heatwaves (extreme hot water events) can substantially disrupt aquatic ecosystems. Although surface heatwaves are well studied, their vertical structures within lakes remain largely unexplored. Here we analyse the characteristics of subsurface lake heatwaves (extreme hot events occurring below the surface) using a spatiotemporal modelling framework. Our findings reveal that subsurface heatwaves are frequent, often longer lasting but less intense than surface events. Deep-water heatwaves (bottom heatwaves) have increased in frequency (7.2 days decade<sup>−1</sup>), duration (2.1 days decade<sup>−1</sup>) and intensity (0.2 °C days decade<sup>−1</sup>) over the past 40 years. Moreover, vertically compounding heatwaves, where extreme heat occurs simultaneously at the surface and bottom, have risen by 3.3 days decade<sup>−1</sup>. By the end of the century, changes in heatwave patterns, particularly under high emissions, are projected to intensify. These findings highlight the need for subsurface monitoring to fully understand and predict the ecological impacts of lake heatwaves.,Nature Climate Change
Monthly 0.05° winter months snow depth dataset for the Northern Hemisphere from 21 CMIP6 models,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04925-w,2025-04-10,Accurate snow depth datasets are crucial for water resource management, comprehensive climate change evaluations, and the sustainable advancement of the ice-and-snow economy in the context of rapid climate change. To create a high-resolution monthly snow depth dataset tailored for the Northern Hemisphere winter months (NHMSD), this study employed the Delta statistical downscaling method, in conjunction with a spatial feature transfer technique, to refine snow depth data derived from 21 major general circulation models and four shared socioeconomic pathways sourced from the CMIP6 project. The NHMSD stands as the world’s pioneering long-term 0.05° snow depth dataset, encompassing the historical era from 1980 to 2014 and extending into future projections from 2015 to 2100. Validation using 2062 ground snow depth observations has confirmed that NHMSD outperforms reanalysis datasets, including ERA5-Land and GLDAS, in terms of root mean square error, bias, and mean absolute error for the periods 1980–2014 and 2015–2023. This dataset facilitates the exploration of potential alterations in snow depth under future scenarios in the Northern Hemisphere.,Scientific Data
Atmospheric drought indices in future projections,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-025-00416-9,2025-04-11,In this Perspective we critically discuss future drought projections, focusing on key issues related to the concept of drought and its frequent confusion with aridity. We address the common misunderstanding between drought metrics and drought indices, as well as misconceptions about what drought indices represent. Our analysis emphasizes the role of atmospheric evaporative demand in shaping future drought severity, along with its drivers, impact processes, and responses to global warming, while highlighting related observational and theoretical challenges. We also shed light on the uncertainties and limitations of Earth system models (ESMs) in assessing future drought severity. We explore the complexities of ESMs in accurately representing plant physiological and hydrological processes, which are crucial for evaluating drought severity. Our discussion also delves into the nuanced effects of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations on these processes and on water dynamics within ESMs, helping to clarify conceptual issues related to atmospheric drought indices. Finally, we advocate for a balanced evaluation of drought metrics, emphasizing the importance of considering multiple atmospheric processes in drought projections.,Nature Water
ERA5–Drought: Global drought indices based on ECMWF reanalysis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04896-y,2025-04-14,Droughts are increasingly intensified by human-induced climate change and pose a growing threat to society. Thus, enhancing our capabilities to monitor drought occurrence and intensity is crucial. This paper introduces a new dataset of drought indices derived from the 5th generation ECMWF reanalysis system (ERA5), which offers long-term monitoring of the global climate in both deterministic and probabilistic forms. This global dataset is freely accessible through an ECMWF-hosted data store, and it entails two prominent drought indices: the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). Both indices are calculated over a range of accumulation periods from 1 month to 4 years and are available for the full ERA5 climatology from 1940 to today. It also contains validation data that indicates the quality of these drought indices. The ERA5–Drought dataset serves as a valuable tool for environmental agencies and supports sectors such as water management and agriculture, thus contributing to efforts that monitor water and food security.,Scientific Data
Patterns and drivers of Holocene moisture variability in mid-latitude eastern North America,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58685-7,2025-04-15,Proxy data for eastern North American hydroclimate indicate strong and persistent multi-millennial droughts during the Holocene, but climate model simulations often fail to reproduce the proxy-inferred droughts. Diagnosing the data–model mismatch can offer valuable insights about the drivers of hydrological variability and different regional sensitivities to hydroclimate forcing. Here we present a proxy–modeling synthesis for Holocene climates in the eastern North American mid-latitudes, including machine-learning-based water balance reconstructions and high-resolution climate simulations. These data-model results resolve prior-generation inconsistencies, show consistent spatiotemporal patterns of Holocene hydroclimate change, and enable assessment of the driving mechanisms. This agreement suggests that the secular summer insolation trend, combined with the Laurentide Ice Sheet deglaciation and its effect on atmospheric circulation, together explain the extent and duration of drier-than-present climates. In addition, our high-resolution proxy data and transient simulations reveal clear multi-centennial climate variability. In our simulations, temperature-driven increases in evapotranspiration exceed regional precipitation gains, drying much of the region during the mid Holocene. This suggests that the mid-Holocene multi-millennial drought was driven by similar processes compared to the drying trajectory projected for mid-latitude North America over this century, which is also primarily driven by warming.,Nature Communications
Cell-scale atmospheric moisture flows dataset reconciled with ERA5 reanalysis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04964-3,2025-04-15,Water vapour flows in the atmosphere are fundamental to the hydrological cycle, linking evaporation sources to precipitation sinks. Recent atmospheric tracking models have provided valuable insights, allowing one to trace the sources of precipitation and determine where evaporated water from specific regions will eventually precipitate. Despite improvements in model accuracy, there remain significant discrepancies between reconstructed and observed evaporation and precipitation data from reanalysis. To address these discrepancies and enhance the reliability of tracking models’ estimates, we propose a procedure based on Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF). Using this approach, we reconcile atmospheric moisture flows reconstructed by the Lagrangian model UTrack with ERA5 reanalysis data. This ensures that the traced atmospheric water matches the total evaporation and the precipitation annually. The reconciled bilateral connections provide a new dataset (RECON) centred on the period 2008-2017 that facilitates the exploration of atmospheric vapour flows between evaporation and precipitation basins at the global scale with a spatial resolution of 0.5°. Further, the proposed framework applies to any cell-scale dataset of atmospheric moisture tracking.,Scientific Data
Recent intensified riverine CO2 emission across the Northern Hemisphere permafrost region,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58716-3,2025-04-16,Global warming causes permafrost thawing, transferring large amounts of soil carbon into rivers, which inevitably accelerates riverine CO<sub>2</sub> release. However, temporally and spatially explicit variations of riverine CO<sub>2</sub> emissions remain unclear, limiting the assessment of land carbon-climate feedback. Using new and published 5685 riverine CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure data in the Arctic and Tibetan Plateau, we show that current riverine CO<sub>2</sub> emission across the Northern Hemisphere permafrost zone is 200 ± 15 Tg C yr⁻<sup>1</sup>. The emission offsets 28.1 ± 2.1% of the land carbon uptake in the Northern Hemisphere permafrost zone, with large regional variability of 13.1 to 63.1%. Our findings suggest that CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increased at a rate of 0.42 ± 0.16 Tg C yr⁻<sup>1</sup> during 2000 to 2020, and this is primarily driven by increased precipitation and accelerated permafrost thawing under climate change. This study highlights increased riverine carbon emission and strengthening of the permafrost carbon feedback to climate after incorporating carbon release from rivers.,Nature Communications
Increasing probability of extreme rainfall preconditioned by humid heatwaves in global coastal megacities,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01023-x,2025-04-16,Hot–wet compound events, the sequential occurrence of humid hot days followed by extreme rainfall, can cause catastrophic consequences, often exceeding the impacts of the isolated occurrence of each event. The urban-coastal microclimate is confounded by complex interactions of land–sea breeze circulations, urban effects of convection and rainfall, and horizontal advection of moisture, which can favor the hot–wet compound occurrence. We present the first observational assessment (1951–2022) of summertime hot–wet compound events across global coastal megacities. We find a significant (P &lt; 0.001) increase in the frequency of hot–wet compound events in both hemispheres: on average, ~3 events in the 1950s to 43 events in the 2020s. Cities with upward trends in the frequency of hot–wet compound events are situated &lt; 30 km from coasts, with cities in the southern hemisphere showing faster hot-to-wet transition times (&lt;3 days) than cities in the northern hemisphere. Further, 26 out of 29 sites show increased extreme precipitation, reaching 153%, when humid heat amplitude rises from the 50th to 90th percentiles. Understanding hot–wet compound interactions over the world’s coasts is highly relevant for climate change impact assessment and informing climate adaptation.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Global dataset combining open-source hydropower plant and reservoir data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04975-0,2025-04-17,Hydropower is a crucial renewable source that depends heavily on water availability. Analyzing drought and climate change impacts on hydropower potential requires detailed data on both hydropower plant attributes (e.g. plant type and head) and reservoir characteristics (e.g. area, depth and volume). However, existing open-source datasets are poorly integrated: hydropower plant datasets often lack reservoir information, while reservoir datasets commonly miss hydropower plant information. This paper addresses this gap by introducing GloHydroRes, a global dataset that combines existing open-source hydropower plant and reservoir datasets. GloHydroRes includes attributes like plant location, head, plant type as well as reservoir details such as dam and reservoir location, dam height, reservoir depth, area, and volume for 7,775 plants in 128 countries. GloHydroRes covers nearly 79% and 81% of the global installed capacity when compared with installed hydropower data as reported by the EIA(2022) and IRENA (2023), respectively. The open-source GloHydroRes dataset provides crucial data to improve hydropower generation modelling at plant level and can support energy security and planning at continent to global scale.,Scientific Data
Water-saving irrigated area expansion hardly enhances crop yield while saving water under climate scenarios in China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02279-0,2025-04-17,Facing climate change risks of water shortages and crop yield losses, it is unclear in China that whether and how irrigated area expansion and technological yield improvement can increase production with less water. Here we used 2000–2018 as the baseline and simulated the grid responses of total crop water use, production, unit water footprint by cropping modes in 2030s–2090 s in 75 scenarios with considering each 5 levels of two adaptation measures under 3 climate change pathways. Compared with climate change alone, further irrigation expansion has limited effects on increasing production (below 20.8%) and decreasing water footprint (below 3.6%). Combined two adaptation measures magnifies their respective effects, with technological yield improvement dominating contributions to production (37.0–99.6%) and water footprint (90.4–102.3%). In comprehensive optimal scenario, water footprint will reduce with increased production. No water is saved with reduced green water (1.6–1.7%) and increased blue water (6.6–21.6%).,Communications Earth & Environment
Enhanced flood synchrony and downstream severity in the Delaware River under rising temperatures,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02243-y,2025-04-17,River floods threaten life and economic stability, with risks increasing globally, especially in densely populated coastal areas. In mountainous coastal watersheds like the Delaware River Basin, rising temperature is projected to reduce snowpack, reshaping upstream–downstream flood dynamics. However, the impact on flood synchronization between upland tributaries and estuarine mainstems remains poorly understood. Using multidecadal streamflow simulations from a high-resolution hydrological model, we find significant increases in the frequency and magnitude of synchronized floods under future warming scenarios, particularly severe floods (above the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile). Under higher warming scenarios, snowpack and rain-on-snow floods in headwater subbasins nearly vanish. Surprisingly, this regime shift amplifies estuarine flooding by enhancing synchronization between historically snow-dominated subbasins and their downstream counterparts. Despite intensified synchronization and flood magnitude, cold-season flood risk declines due to fewer rain-on-snow events. Conversely, summer floods grow larger, more frequent, and synchronized, driving a seasonal reconfiguration of flood risk that should be considered in future mitigation strategies.,Communications Earth & Environment
Warming leads to both earlier and later snowmelt floods over the past 70 years,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58832-0,2025-04-17,Climate warming reduces snow cover in cold regions, altering snowmelt flood regimes with significant hydrological and ecological consequences. Existing evidence indicates that as climate warms, snowmelt tends to begin earlier in the season, leading to earlier snowmelt floods. Here we show that the timing of snowmelt floods can be either advanced or delayed under warming. Using streamflow observations from 1950–2020 and an event-based analysis that distinguishes flood-generating mechanisms across 2339 Northern Hemisphere, snow-affected catchments, we show that the earlier snowmelt effect can be substantially offset or even reversed by a decelerated snowmelt rate under warming. This results in delayed snowmelt floods in approximately 30% of the catchments, contributing to an overall minor shift on a hemispheric scale (−0.87 ± 2.4 days per decade). Our findings challenge the prevailing “warming leads to earlier snowmelt floods” paradigm, revealing a more complex pattern of changes in snowmelt flood in a warming world.,Nature Communications
Assessing the consistent and divergent impacts of urbanization on heavy rainfall in Chinese urban agglomerations,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02283-4,2025-04-18,Understanding the impact of urbanization on extreme precipitation is crucial for promoting sustainable urban development in the context of global warming and rapid urban expansion. Here we found the highest impacts in humid regions such as the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta, where urbanization amplifies extreme rainfall intensities, varying with the rate of urbanization across the representative cities. Moreover, the impact is greater at the 3-hourly scale compared to the daily scale in most cities in humid regions. However, we found no significant impact of urbanization on extreme rainfall across continental climate regions like the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei. Furthermore, we also found that urbanization alters the trends of heavy rainfall during daytime and nighttime, with significant regional variations linked to impervious surface coverage. Our findings provide essential scientific evidence to assist cities in designing targeted disaster mitigation policies, especially for those with diverse contexts and development patterns.,Communications Earth & Environment
ROBIN: Reference observatory of basins for international hydrological climate change detection,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04907-y,2025-04-18,Human-induced warming is modifying the water cycle. Adaptation to posed threats requires an understanding of hydrological responses to climate variability. Whilst these can be computationally modelled, observed streamflow data is essential for constraining models, and understanding and quantifying emerging trends in the water cycle. To date, the identification of such trends at the global scale has been hindered by data limitations – in particular, the prevalence of direct human influences on streamflow which can obscure climate-driven variability. By removing these influences, trends in streamflow data can be more confidently attributed to climate variability. Here we describe the Reference Observatory of Basins for INternational hydrological climate change detection (ROBIN) – the first iteration of a global network of streamflow data from national reference hydrological networks (RHNs) – comprised of catchments which are near-natural or have limited human influences. This collaboration has established a freely available global RHN dataset of over 3,000 catchments and code libraries, which can be used to underpin new science endeavours and advance change detection studies to support international climate policy and adaptation.,Scientific Data
Global assessment and hotspots of lake drought,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02285-2,2025-04-21,Many lakes have exhibited substantial variability in recent years, making “lake drought” a growing concern. However, there is no established framework for identifying and studying lake droughts. Here, we propose a reliable definition for it and provide a global assessment of over 160,000 lakes (≥1 km<sup>2</sup>) using monthly area data from 1985 to 2018. Our findings show that 15.7% of lakes have experienced statistically significant increasing trends in drought frequency (p &lt; 0.05), with hotspots in the Southern United States at 52.7% and Southeast Australia at 70.4%. Furthermore, we identify two severe lake drought events in the Southern United States (2012–2014) and Southeast Australia (2007–2010), posing dramatic threats to water supplies, biodiversity, and ecological health. Rising trends in lake drought are driven by increasing temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and factors associated with the lake water cycle, such as precipitation deficit, increased evaporation, and excessive water withdrawal.,Communications Earth & Environment
High-resolution gridded streamflow data for Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basins in Bangladesh (1951–2023),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05014-8,2025-04-22,A 9-km daily gridded streamflow dataset is generated using the Variable Infiltration Capacity-River Routing Model (VIC-RRM) across the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River basins over 1951–2023, forced by the ERA5-Land reanalysis data for naturalized streamflow. Physically consistent streamflow forecast data is also generated forced by the ECMWF S2S forecasts. The performance of the dataset is evaluated using observed streamflow data from three gauge stations in Bangladesh along the streams of Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna Rivers, calculating the modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (mKGE) metric for the 365-day climatology. For Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna Rivers, the mKGE values of reconstructed streamflow data are 0.50, 0.75, and 0.25, respectively. Comparing with the reconstructed streamflow data, the streamflow forecasts show a good agreement with mKGE values of 1.00, 0.97, and 0.91 at three gauge stations, respectively. This dataset provides physically consistent reconstructed and forecasted streamflow data at high resolution, offering a valuable resource for the assessment of climate variability and change and the development of river basin-specific water management strategies in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Rivers in Bangladesh.,Scientific Data
Flood fatalities and displacement influence human migration in floodplains of developing countries,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02293-2,2025-04-24,Understanding what drives human migration in floodplains is critical for mitigating risks and enhancing resilience to floods. However, existing global analyses have not fully explored these complex dynamics. Here we introduce a metric, human-flood distance change, to track migration in floodplains from 2000 to 2018, exploring the interplay of climatic and anthropogenic influences. We find that in developing countries, including India, Argentina, Brazil and Nigeria, flood fatalities and displacement strongly influence migration decisions, often forcing populations to move away or toward flood-prone areas due to flood damage memory or resource needs. Conversely, regions with higher flood protection, such as the United States, show migration trends away from hazardous areas. Climatic drivers, like flood inundation area, exert stronger influences in Australia. Notably, in the Philippines and Kenya, the easing of drought-flood abrupt alternation has led to increased population movement toward flood-prone areas, underscoring the complex interactions between multiple hazards.,Communications Earth & Environment
Glacier meltwater has limited contributions to the total runoff in the major rivers draining the Tibetan Plateau,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01060-6,2025-04-25,The Tibetan Plateau is the headwaters of several major river basins, but uncertainties exist in the estimated contributions of glacial melt and groundwater to runoff. We present a new tracer-aided glacio-hydrological model constrained by multiple datasets for five major river basins of the Tibetan Plateau. We show that the contribution of glacier melt to the annual runoff is less than 5% in all the five basins at the outlets—much less than previous estimates. Our secondary finding is that the partitioning between surface runoff and groundwater flow varied greatly across the watersheds, with groundwater runoff contributing 35–75% of the annual runoff. The contribution of glacier melt has a strong spatial variability and scale dependency, but the population heavily dependent on it is limited, so a potential significant decrease in water resources due to glacier shrinkage is not a problem that should raise public worries in the Tibetan Plateau.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Hydropower system in the Yarlung-Tsangpo Grand Canyon can mitigate flood disasters caused by climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02247-8,2025-04-26,The world’s largest diversion-type hydropower system will be created on the Yarlung-Tsangpo Grand Canyon. The canyon, a critical region for hydropower development and ecological conservation, faces challenges under climate change. Here we evaluate the water-energy-ecosystem nexus in this hydropower system using the Water and Energy Transfer Processes in Large River Basins model and the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III model. Key findings reveal that reservoir operations with medium replenishment flow (1000 m³ s<sup>−1</sup>) during dry periods achieve an optimal balance among hydropower generation annually (2231 × 10<sup>8</sup> kWh), flood mitigation (peak clipping rate 22.8%), and minimal ecosystem impact (eco-index 0.45). Hydropower development stabilizes runoff regimes, enhances flood control capacity under climate scenarios (e.g., 29.2% peak reduction under Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 126), and mitigates downstream flood risks while supporting dry-season irrigation and navigation. Notably, under low-forcing climate change scenarios (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 126), ecosystem stability is sustained primarily through the gradual and consistent replenishment of water resources from stabilized snowpack and glacial reserves. Transboundary cooperation is strengthened through adaptive reservoir management, ensuring energy security for China and flood protection for downstream nations. This integrated approach highlights the potential for harmonizing sustainable hydropower expansion with ecological and geopolitical resilience in international river basins.,Communications Earth & Environment
Enhanced heating effect of lakes under global warming,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59291-3,2025-04-27,Lakes play a crucial role in shaping both local and regional climates through heat exchange with the atmosphere. Amid global climate change, these interactions have undergone significant shifts. However, our understanding of the global heat release from lakes to the atmosphere, and its future trajectory, remains limited. In this study, we investigate changes in global lake heat release patterns and identify an amplified increase in heat release, particularly in mid to high latitudes (&gt;45°N). This amplification is linked with a feedback mechanism, where the reduction in lake ice cover not only reduces the insulating effect between the warmer lake water and the colder atmosphere but also leads to increased heat absorption by lakes. As a result, lakes in mid-high latitudes experience a greater relative increase in heat release, primarily through upward thermal radiation, compared to lakes at lower latitudes with comparable surface water temperature increases. Additionally, seasonal variations in latent heat flux intensify the heat release during warmer seasons compared to colder ones. Future projections suggest substantially greater heat release compared to historical trends.,Nature Communications
Drag acting on suspended sediment increased by microbial colonization,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-025-01679-3,2025-04-28,The dynamic interplay between microbial communities and sediment transport shapes continental landscapes and influences particulate matter fluxes across the Earth’s surface. Microbial colonization transforms individual sediment grains into aggregates with intricate and varied morphologies, complicating sediment transport. However, current models often simplify this morphological complexity, assuming that aggregates experience fluid drag equal to that of smooth spheres or idealized shapes. Here we apply an X-ray micro-computed tomography method combined with computational fluid dynamics simulations to analyse aggregate morphology at high spatial resolution and determine the relationship with drag. Instead of aggregate size or gross shape being the primary controls on drag, we find that microbial colonization alters the fine-scale aggregate morphology and increases drag by factors of 1–3 compared with smooth surfaces. We propose a morphology-corrected drag law that accounts for this complexity, reconciling the differences in drag across diverse aggregates. Our findings suggest that a shift from focusing on gross scale variabilities (size or gross shape) to fine-scale morphologies could enable greater accuracy in transport predictions, and improve understanding of microbially colonized aggregates in fluvial, coastal and oceanic systems.,Nature Geoscience
Carbonate weathering enhances nitrogen assimilatory uptake in rivers globally,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-025-01680-w,2025-04-28,Bedrock composition, in particular the proportion of carbonate, can influence the dissolved inorganic carbon concentration and also the carbonate chemistry of rivers, but its effects on the nitrogen cycle in rivers are usually overlooked. Here we present geochemical composition measurements of rivers across the Pearl River Basin in China that show that dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) is positively correlated with dissolved inorganic nitrogen and follows the variation in solar radiation in the carbonate-dominated region during the wet season, but not in the non-carbonate-dominated region. In situ incubations show that organic nitrogen production is strengthened in the regions with high dissolved inorganic carbon and high temperature and solar radiation. DON zonation in the dry season is not obvious owing to the limitation of low temperature on nitrogen assimilation. We also report a similar DON contrast in carbonate-dominated and non-carbonate-dominated regions in Malang in Indonesia. Furthermore, from an analysis of global published data, we find that a modified Michaelis–Menten model incorporating carbon limitation provides a much better fit to the global latitudinal distribution of DON globally. Hence, we propose that carbonate weathering enhancement of organic nitrogen production occurs ubiquitously.,Nature Geoscience
Sentinel-3 Altimetry Thematic Products for Hydrology, Sea Ice and Land Ice,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04956-3,2025-04-29,This paper presents the Copernicus Sentinel-3 level-2 altimetry Hydro-Cryo “Thematic Products”, operationally generated by ESA since September 2023. In comparison to previous product versions, the level-2 processing is now performed through three independent chains, generating three families of “Thematic Products”, for measurements acquired over hydrological, sea ice and land ice areas, respectively. Prior to the operational deployment, a full mission reprocessing was achieved with the thematic processors, providing a complete and harmonised dataset to the users. In this paper, the new architecture of the ground segment processing is presented, along with the major algorithmic developments. The main data content of the Thematic Products is also described, to indicate the key product variables for the end users. The Thematic Products have been evaluated by the Sentinel-3 Mission Performance Cluster (MPC) experts. The major results and outcomes are presented, showing the significant performance improvement achieved in comparison to previous processing versions.,Scientific Data
TSWS: An observation-based streamflow dataset of Tianshan Mountains watersheds (1901–2019),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05046-0,2025-04-29,Due to scarcity of data and complex hydrological conditions in the Tianshan region, long-term and complete streamflow data are lacking. This study produced a multi-basin streamflow dataset, named Tianshan watershed streamflow (TSWS) dataset, by comparing the results of Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenavdelning and Long Short-Term Memory models, and analyzed spatiotemporal variation of streamflow.TSWS dataset provides daily streamflow data for 56 watersheds and monthly streamflow data for 89 watersheds in the Tianshan Mountains in 1901–2019. The streamflow simulations of 40 watersheds (daily scale) and 70 watersheds (monthly scale) passed the S-tests (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency ≥0.5, percent bias ≤25%, and ratio of the root-mean-square error to the standard deviation of measured data ≤0.7). The dataset showed an overall increasing trend of streamflow, especially from 1990 to 2019; spatially, it showed higher streamflow in the west and south, and lower streamflow in the east and north. The dataset provides the first comprehensive simulation and its long time series will provide an important reference for climatic and hydrological studies.,Scientific Data
A global dataset of remote sensing-based soil critical point and permanent wilting point,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05048-y,2025-04-30,The critical point (CP) and permanent wilting point (PWP) are key soil hydraulic characteristics that control the land surface energy budget and water balance. There is a lack of available data for these parameters on the global scale. This study extracts CP and PWP through soil moisture drydown (SMD) and provides global yearly soil hydraulic properties from a long-term (2002–2023) remote-sensing soil moisture product (Neural Network-based Soil Moisture, NNsm). Validated against 1334 stations from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN), the results show that the global medians of CP and PWP based on the NNsm are robust over time, and outperform the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) dataset in accuracy due to the advantage of daily temporal resolution. Furthermore, this dataset holds an advantage over existing products, as it is derived from a multi-year climatological mean state and solely from satellite-based soil moisture observation. The derived dataset is useful for those who wish to connect land-atmosphere characteristics with their interests, as well as calibrate land surface models.,Scientific Data
High flows contributed a large part of annual contaminant yields in New Zealand’s rivers,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02238-9,2025-04-30,Accurate contaminant yield estimation in rivers is essential to developing water quality policies and monitoring their effectiveness over time. We assessed the contribution of high-flows (≥90th percentile) to total yields of nitrate-nitrogen, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and E. coli calculated from monthly data over 15 years (310–325 sites) in New Zealand, and at 24 sites with high-frequency (30-min) nitrate-nitrogen and total phosphorus. High flows contributed 51–74% of annual contaminant yields at long-term sites and 48% of nitrate-nitrogen and 63% of total phosphorus in the high-frequency sites. Mean uncertainties in annual yields estimated from monthly monitoring data (compared to the true yield, calculated from high-frequency records) were 29% for nitrate-nitrogen and 52% for total phosphorus. Daily sampling was needed to reduce uncertainty to &lt;10% especially in catchments with a high proportion of agricultural land use.,Communications Earth & Environment
Recent weakening of carbon-water coupling in northern ecosystems,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01059-z,2025-04-30,The terrestrial carbon and water cycles are deeply intertwined, and their coupling is critical to shaping ecosystem processes and land-atmosphere feedback. Understanding how the carbon-water coupling (CWC) changes, which remains rarely explored, is essential for predicting eco-hydrological responses to climate change. Here, using data from eddy covariance towers and remote sensing, we demonstrate a substantial decline in the CWC strength—measured as the correlation between gross primary production and evapotranspiration—across northern ecosystems over the past two decades. This weakening is primarily driven by rising CO₂ levels, with temperature, solar radiation, and precipitation playing secondary roles. Land surface models in the TRENDY project fail to capture this weakening synchronization, primarily due to their inadequate representation of the effects of elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels. The weakening of this synchronous variation between water and carbon may signify that the ecosystems are reshaping their eco-hydrological balances across the Northern Hemisphere.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Quantitative assessment on the distribution patterns of microplastics in global inland waters,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02320-2,2025-04-30,Microplastics (MPs) contamination in global inland waters has raised concerns recently. However, quantitative research on the abundance of MP in these environments remains limited. Here we compiled a comprehensive dataset of MPs in global inland waters from 5365 observations across 301 publications, revealing a diverse distribution of MP abundance in inland waters, ranging from 0.00 to 4,275,800.70 items m<sup>−3</sup> (mean: 25,255.47 ± 132,808.40 items m<sup>−3</sup>). Human development index, evapotranspiration, cropland, and land surface runoff emerged as the primary factors influencing MPs levels in water. The predicting map showed particularly high MP abundance in China, but also relatively high abundance in Asia, Europe, Africa, and the eastern United States.,Communications Earth & Environment
Hybrid approaches enhance hydrological model usability for local streamflow prediction,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02324-y,2025-04-30,Hydrological models are essential for predicting water flux dynamics, including extremes, and managing water resources, yet traditional process-based large-scale models often struggle with accuracy and process understanding due to their inability to represent complex, non-linear hydrometeorological processes, limiting their effectiveness in local conditions. Here we explore hybrid methods combining process-based modelling and statistical or machine learning post-processors to improve streamflow predictive accuracy, including extremes, across Europe’s hydro-climatic gradient. We investigate various post-processing methods, such as random forest, long short-term memory model, quantile mapping and generalised linear model, demonstrating notable improvements in model performance, in terms of reducing errors in total volume and extremes and increasing robustness across diverse climatic and geographic conditions. We further show that hydrologic similarity is one of the key drivers that control the hybrid approach’s improvements, together with other basin characteristics, such as mean precipitation and mean temperature. Our results also reveal spatial complementarity among the post-processing methods, with no absolute superiority identified from a single method, pointing towards multi-model averaging approaches for the future evolution of hybrid hydrological modelling.,Communications Earth & Environment
CMIP6-driven 10 km super-resolution daily climate projections with PET estimates in China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05071-z,2025-04-30,Global warming has intensified extreme weather events, posing challenges to regional climate and hydro-ecological systems. To address the low-resolution limitations of current multi-climate variables and potential evapotranspiration (PET), this study develops a super-resolution fusion framework based on deep residual attention mechanisms, establishing China’s 10-km resolution multi-model-multi-scenario high-resolution climate and PET dataset (SRCPCN10). The Residual Channel Attention Network (RCAN) demonstrates exceptional downscaling performance for temperature, radiation, and pressure (R<sup>2</sup>/KGE &gt; 0.99), while precipitation exhibits significantly lower accuracy (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.897) due to spatial discontinuity. The findings reveal distinct emission-gradient responses in China’s future climate variables under SSP scenarios, with temperature, radiation, and precipitation increases escalating alongside radiative forcing intensification. The comparison of annual mean differences between original CMIP6 and downscaled data showed excellent agreement, with most climate indices differing by less than 1%. This work overcomes traditional limitations, providing kilometer-scale multivariate data for watershed hydrological modeling, agricultural climate risk assessment, and carbon-neutral pathway optimization, enhancing the precision of regional adaptation strategies.,Scientific Data
Pesticides application rate maps in the European Union at a 250 m spatial resolution,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05031-7,2025-05-01,Our work targets mapping of pesticides application rates within the European Union at a 250 m spatial resolution. Source data include global estimates of pesticide inputs, high resolution crop maps and pesticide usage reported by EUROSTAT official figures. Previously published global pesticide application rates in PEST-CHEMGRIDS are used as first guess estimates. These are then adjusted using a calibration dataset gathered from pesticide use in agriculture. The estimation of the applied mass by country and crop type is then combined with high resolution crop maps. The procedure explicitly accounts for data quality and uncertainty through a Maximum Likelihood estimation procedure. This data product features detailed spatial distributions of pesticide inputs, facilitating evaluation of pesticide fate and transport, biogeochemical transformations as well as environmental risk assessment.,Scientific Data
Underground well water level observation grid dataset from 2005 to 2022,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04799-y,2025-05-02,Groundwater, a vital hydrological cycle component, is essential in sustaining ecosystem functions and human livelihoods. The dataset presented herein, derived from the China Geological Environment Monitoring Groundwater Level Yearbook (2005–2022) compiled by the China Geological Environment Monitoring Institute, integrates long-term observational data from groundwater monitoring wells across China. The dataset comprises 11,911 monitoring points and 4,275,506 observation records, with each site providing five observations per month. To enhance its spatial and temporal coverage, the dataset was processed using the inverse distance weighting interpolation method, generating groundwater level raster data with spatial and temporal resolutions of 1 km and one month, respectively. Validation of the interpolated data demonstrated high accuracy, with regression coefficients and R<sup>2</sup> values approaching 1 across multiple validation regions, and root-mean-square error and mean-square error metrics remaining acceptable. Spanning 2005–2022, the dataset is available in standard GeoTIFF format, rendering it ideal for geographic information system analysis. It provides a robust foundation for investigating groundwater dynamics, exploring interactions with surface ecosystems, and supporting sustainable water management practices.,Scientific Data
Spatially inhomogeneous response of precipitation δ18O in China to ENSO cycles,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01057-1,2025-05-02,Water stable isotopes serve as essential natural tracers, offering broad applications in water cycle, atmosphere science and paleoclimate rebuilding. In this study, we created a precipitation stable isotope dataset for 1961–2022 by developing a fusion machine learning model, and mapped the time-series precipitation isoscape (δ<sup>18</sup>O) across the mainland of China over the past 62 years. This dataset allows for a further discussion on spatially different behavior of precipitation δ<sup>18</sup>O to the strong ENSO events, and we found that δ<sup>18</sup>O values are higher in El Niño years and lower in La Niña years in the southern of the line roughly from 30°N 80°E to 40°N 120°E, not fully consistent with the northern region. We also revealed an increasing trend in precipitation δ<sup>18</sup>O in the Western arid region and Eastern monsoon region in the past decades, while no significant trend on the Tibetan Plateau. These findings enhance our understanding of the climatic control mechanisms influencing precipitation isotopes and benefit paleoclimate rebuilding.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Groundwater dominates snowmelt runoff and controls streamflow efficiency in the western United States,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02303-3,2025-05-03,Climate change in seasonally snow-covered mountain catchments is reducing water supply and decreasing streamflow predictability. Here, we use tritium age dating to show that contrary to the common assumption that snowmelt quickly contributes to runoff, streamflow during snowmelt in western US catchments is dominated by older groundwater. The average age of streamwater during snowmelt runoff (5.7 ± 4.3 years) was intermediate to the average age of groundwater (10.4 ± 4.5 years) and recent precipitation, indicating that 58% (±34%) of snowmelt runoff was derived from groundwater. Water ages, streamflow, and groundwater storage were mediated by bedrock geology: low-permeability hard rock/shale catchments exhibited younger ages, less storage, and more efficient streamflow generation than high-permeability sandstone/clastic catchments. Our results demonstrate that snowmelt runoff is the result of multiple prior years of climate mediated by groundwater storage. Including these interactions will be crucial for predicting water resources as climate and landscape changes accelerate.,Communications Earth & Environment
Reconciling tracked atmospheric water flows to close the global freshwater cycle,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02289-y,2025-05-05,Atmospheric moisture flows play a vital role in the hydrological cycle, connecting evaporation sources to precipitation sinks. While high-resolution tracking models provide valuable insights, discrepancies arise comparing tracked flows to atmospheric reanalysis data. Here we reconcile tracked atmospheric flows with reanalysis data by means of the Iterative Proportional Fitting applied to the UTrack dataset (averaged over 2008–2017) aggregated within countries and ocean boundaries. It corrects country-scale discrepancies of up to 275% in precipitation and 225% in evaporation, adjusting bilateral flows by ~ 0.07 %, on average. The resulting dataset ensures that the total tracked moisture matches total precipitation at the sink and evaporation at the source annually. Remarkably, this procedure can be applied to any tracking model output and scale of analysis. The reconciled dataset enhances transboundary atmospheric water flows analysis, revealing that 45% of total terrestrial precipitation (~1.5 ⋅ 10<sup>5</sup> km<sup>3</sup>yr<sup>−1</sup>) originates from land evaporation (9.8 ⋅ 10<sup>4</sup> km<sup>3</sup>yr<sup>−1</sup>).,Communications Earth & Environment
Disparity in spatiotemporal variability and risk of compound coastal extremes between India’s East-West coasts,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01045-5,2025-05-06,The Indian East Coast is susceptible to concurrent storm surge-rainfall (SS-RF) extremes during June–November, driven by low-pressure systems of varying intensity from the Bay of Bengal during monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Contrarily, the West Coast witnesses these extremes primarily during monsoon, driven by depressions in the Arabian Sea and troughs of low pressure along the coast. Higher frequency of these extremes was witnessed on the West (East) Coast when the positive (negative) phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole co-occurred with the Neutral (La Niña or Neutral) phase of El Niño Southern Oscillation. Further, the SS-RF extremes on the East Coast (West Coast except Mumbai) were storm surge (rainfall) dominant, with higher risk at Haldia (Mumbai). On the other hand, a higher (lower) frequency of concurrent sea level-rainfall extremes was witnessed on the East (West) Coast due to disparity in tidal ranges and seasonality of coastal currents.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Water-saving strategies across prefectures should target the manufacturing and agriculture sectors in China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02292-3,2025-05-06,Water scarcity is a global challenge in many emerging economies, including China. China is one of the most extensive freshwater users and has set water efficiency improvement goals for 2030 at the prefecture level. However, no systematic water use and savings comparison exists across prefectures and sectors. Here, we used datasets of water withdrawal for 10,608 industrial and 1715 agricultural sub-sectors for 343 prefectures, and explored the opportunities to reduce water use. Results show that 10% of the least water-efficient industrial sub-sectors represent a disproportionate 46% water use. 18.9 km<sup>3</sup> (±3.2%) water saving in industry and 50.3 km<sup>3</sup> (±2.3%) in agriculture could be achieved, equivalent to Russia’s annual demand. A minority of sectors, including cloth(ing)- and chemical-manufacturing, rice-, vegetable- and fruit-cultivation, could contribute the most to water savings. Our study is essential for identifying water use and efficiency information for individual prefectures and sectors.,Communications Earth & Environment
How extreme rainfall and failing dams unleashed the Derna flood disaster,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59261-9,2025-05-06,On September 11, 2023, Storm Daniel unleashed unprecedented rainfall over the Wadi Derna watershed, triggering one of the most devastating floods in modern history, striking Derna, a coastal city in Libya. This study reconstructs the disaster using an integrated modeling approach that combines satellite imagery, hydrologic, hydraulic, and geotechnical simulations, machine learning, eyewitness accounts, and digital elevation data to assess the impact of cascading dam failures. Our findings reveal that the region’s dams, even if structurally sound, would have provided minimal protection against the extreme runoff. However, their failure unleashed a destructive surge wave, amplifying the disaster’s magnitude and devastation. Here, we show that the collapse of aging flood control infrastructures, compounded by inadequate risk assessment and emergency preparedness, dramatically escalated the disaster’s impact. Our findings underscore the urgent need for systematic dam safety evaluations, enhanced flood forecasting, and adaptive risk management strategies that address climate extremes and infrastructure vulnerabilities.,Nature Communications
Carbon accumulation in recently deposited peat is reduced by increased nutrient supply,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59387-w,2025-05-08,High-latitude mires store a considerable part of the global soil carbon. Current understanding suggests that wetter conditions promote carbon accumulation. This paradigm is based primarily on temperate ombrogenic bogs and overlooks the influence of minerogenic water from the catchment area, despite most northern mires being minerogenic fens. Here we show that minerogenic water is the main negative influence on past century carbon accumulation in boreal fens. This effect is most pronounced in mires formed during the last millennia. Rather than enhancing productivity, minerogenic water stimulates organic matter decay, apart from in elevated hummocks where both decay and productivity were stimulated. These findings reshape our understanding of carbon cycling at high-latitudes, highlighting how shifts in precipitation-evapotranspiration may impact carbon sequestration in fens, which are widespread in the circum-arctic. Contrary to expectations for temperate regions, we argue that increased catchment water input in sub-arctic peatlands is unlikely to enhance mire carbon accumulation.,Nature Communications
Different responses of extreme and mean precipitation to land use and land cover changes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01049-1,2025-05-08,Land use and land cover changes (LULCCs) can influence precipitation via changes in surface energy, water flux, and large-scale atmospheric circulation, with great implications for the sustainable development of nature and society. However, the impacts and mechanisms of these contributors to extreme precipitation changes compared with mean changes still need to be investigated. Here, we used the moisture budget equation to decompose precipitation changes into three primary contributing factors (evapotranspiration, atmospheric mean circulation, and water vapor) based on CMIP6-LUMIP experiments. A global reduction in mean precipitation due to LULCCs can be attributed to relatively equal contributions of changes in evapotranspiration and atmospheric mean circulation over the historical (1995–2014) and future (2080–2099) periods. In contrast, during the top drying month, the precipitation reduction is approximately 2–3 times greater than the multi-year mean change. The dynamic contributor representing the mean circulation change surpasses evapotranspiration as the primary contributor driving the extreme precipitation decrease in the majority of the landscape. The socioeconomic impacts of LULCCs-induced extreme precipitation changes are greater than those of the mean state, especially in the future.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
A West Antarctic grounding-zone environment shaped by episodic water flow,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-025-01687-3,2025-05-12,Beneath Antarctica’s ice sheets, a little-observed network of liquid water connects vast landscapes and contributes to the motion of the overriding ice. When this subglacial water reaches the ocean cavity beneath ice shelves, it mixes with seawater, amplifying melt and in places forming deep channels in the base of the ice. Here we present observations from a hot-water-drilled borehole documenting subglacial water entering the ocean cavity at the grounding zone of Kamb Ice Stream and the Ross Ice Shelf. Our observations show that melt has removed approximately a third of the ice thickness, yet measurements reveal low rates of subglacial discharge in a turbid plume. Sediment cored from the channel floor shows larger discharge events occur and episodically deposit material from distinct geological domains. We quantify subglacial discharge and link our observations to the catchment upstream. We conclude that discrete discharge events are likely to dominate channel melt and sediment transport and result in the extensive ice-shelf features downstream of Kamb Ice Stream.,Nature Geoscience
Similarities and divergent patterns in hydrologic fluxes and storages simulated by global water models,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-025-00435-6,2025-05-12,Global water models (GWMs) are critical tools for understanding the Earth’s water cycle and water resource management under a changing climate and accelerating human interventions. Although GWMs have been evaluated for hydrologic fluxes (for example, river discharge) and the role of representing human activities, there is a persistent gap in understanding models’ ability to simultaneously reproduce fluxes and storages (for example, terrestrial water storage (TWS)). Here we show that eight state-of-the-art GWMs do not consistently reproduce discharge and TWS with the same efficacy across varied geographic and climatic regions. Furthermore, model performance for discharge deteriorates as human impacts intensify. While a general agreement between simulated and observed TWS trends is found in two-thirds of major global river basins, models tend to underestimate the trends in both directions. Likewise, no single model simulates TWS trends and seasonality accurately and uniformly across major global river basins. Although improvements in capturing basin-averaged TWS trends, spatial distributions and seasonal fluctuations have been achieved compared with previous reports, challenges remain in accurately reproducing both fluxes and storages, owing primarily to inadequate representation of human activities in heavily managed regions. This study underscores critical disparities in GWM performance, emphasizing the need for further model enhancements, which is crucial for improved and more robust hydrologic assessments and predictions under climate change.,Nature Water

Similarities and divergent patterns in hydrologic fluxes and storages simulated by global water models,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-025-00435-6,2025-05-12,Global water models (GWMs) are critical tools for understanding the Earth’s water cycle and water resource management under a changing climate and accelerating human interventions. Although GWMs have been evaluated for hydrologic fluxes (for example, river discharge) and the role of representing human activities, there is a persistent gap in understanding models’ ability to simultaneously reproduce fluxes and storages (for example, terrestrial water storage (TWS)). Here we show that eight state-of-the-art GWMs do not consistently reproduce discharge and TWS with the same efficacy across varied geographic and climatic regions. Furthermore, model performance for discharge deteriorates as human impacts intensify. While a general agreement between simulated and observed TWS trends is found in two-thirds of major global river basins, models tend to underestimate the trends in both directions. Likewise, no single model simulates TWS trends and seasonality accurately and uniformly across major global river basins. Although improvements in capturing basin-averaged TWS trends, spatial distributions and seasonal fluctuations have been achieved compared with previous reports, challenges remain in accurately reproducing both fluxes and storages, owing primarily to inadequate representation of human activities in heavily managed regions. This study underscores critical disparities in GWM performance, emphasizing the need for further model enhancements, which is crucial for improved and more robust hydrologic assessments and predictions under climate change.,Nature Water
Semi-continuous release of Cordilleran Ice Sheet meltwater between 20,000 and 17,000 years ago,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-025-01694-4,2025-05-13,Terrestrial evidence of ice-sheet meltwater events during the last deglaciation are exceptionally rare. However, they are a valuable complement to marine records that suggest immense ice-sheet meltwater pulses discharging into the Northeast Pacific, termed Siku events. Here we describe and date a terrestrial Cordilleran Ice Sheet meltwater archive in a karstified glacial outwash plain during the early last deglaciation, showing semi-continuous meltwater events between about 20,000 and 17,000 years ago.,Nature Geoscience
Concurrent superimposed ice formation and meltwater runoff on Greenland’s ice slabs,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59237-9,2025-05-14,Rivers and slush fields on the Greenland Ice Sheet increasingly develop in locations where the accumulation zone hosts near-impermeable ice slabs. However, the division between runoff versus retention in these areas remains unmeasured. We present field measurements of superimposed ice formation onto slabs around the visible runoff limit. The quantity of superimposed ice varies by proximity to visible surface water and the surface slope, highlighting that meltwater can flow laterally before refreezing. We use heat conduction modelling and radar observations of autumn wetness to show that in our field area in 2022, 65% of superimposed ice formed during summer and the rest during autumn in the relict supraglacial hydrological network. Overall, 84% of melt around the visible runoff limit refroze. Ice-sheet-wide we estimate that slabs refroze 56 gigatonnes of melt (26-69 gigatonnes according to slab extent) between 2017 and 2022. Slabs are thus both hotspots of refreezing and emerging zones of runoff.,Nature Communications
Rising atmospheric moisture escalates the future impact of atmospheric rivers in the Antarctic climate system,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02333-x,2025-05-14,Despite their relative rarity, atmospheric rivers are key contributors to the surface mass balance of Antarctica. However, the future role of atmospheric rivers in modulating Antarctic sea-level contributions is a major area of uncertainty. Here, we leverage high-resolution climate simulations to show that Antarctic atmospheric rivers are highly sensitive to future increases in atmospheric moisture, leading to a doubling of atmospheric river frequencies and 2.5 × increase in precipitation from 2066–2100 under present-day thresholds for atmospheric river detection. However, future precipitation impacts are critically dependent on the detection threshold: accounting for moisture increases in the threshold produces smaller, regional changes in atmospheric river frequency, primarily resulting from an eastward shift in the polar jet maximum wind speeds. Our results underscore the importance of using large ensembles to quantify Antarctic atmospheric river responses to variability in projected moisture, which may not be captured when using only a few ensemble members.,Communications Earth & Environment
How February 2022 redefines extreme floods in Australia,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02307-z,2025-05-15,In February 2022, eastern Australia experienced an extreme flood due to a combination of intense rainfall and close to saturation initial soil water conditions. It resulted in record-breaking water levels and flood volumes, leading to Australia’s largest total insurance claim for a single flood event. Here we analyse the physical factors underlying this event and compare them with a large dataset of floods in Australia dating back to 1950. Our findings show that February 2022 had the largest impact on design flood volumes with a 1% annual exceedance probability, which are expected to increase by 16% on average across the affected region. Additionally, this flood prompted major changes in national flood risk management, including upgrades to flood warning networks and a comprehensive review of the flood insurance sector.,Communications Earth & Environment
Deltaic freshwater scarcity driven by unsustainable groundwater-fed irrigation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-025-01566-0,2025-05-16,Southern Asia benefits from groundwater pumping for dry-season irrigation by increasing both crop productivity and monsoon aquifer recharge rates in the region. On the basis of a data-driven integrated modelling system, we provide numerical evidence that the impacts of unsustainable groundwater-fed irrigation on surface freshwater availability go beyond what was previously understood. Our results confirm findings from previous studies showing increased groundwater recharge rates during wet seasons over 2002–2021, but these rates are insufficient for aquifers to recover, gradually depleting groundwater across the Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna delta. The main findings are that this increased recharge causes a drop in surface runoff and baseflow generation during the monsoons, resulting in lower flood risk (a beneficial outcome), but also less surface freshwater available for farming, which may trigger additional groundwater demand. The drop in coastal flood risk induced by inland groundwater-fed irrigation exceeds the increase caused by sea level rise by about five- to tenfold. Reduced runoff may also increase seawater intrusion, driven by less freshwater to push ocean water away, further increasing freshwater scarcity. This is particularly concerning, since the region has been under rising sea levels and sinking lands. Our findings over this delta have global implications, as humans and climate are increasingly pressuring coastal and deltaic ecosystems worldwide.,Nature Sustainability
Streaks on martian slopes are dry,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59395-w,2025-05-19,Slope streaks are dark albedo features on martian slopes that form spontaneously and fade over years to decades. Along with seasonally recurring slope lineae, streak formation has been attributed to aqueous processes, implying the presence of transient yet substantial amounts of liquid water or brines on Mars’ surface, with important implications for present-day Mars’ habitability. Here, we use a deep learning-enabled approach to create the first consistent, global catalog of half a million individual slope streaks. We show that slope streaks modify less than 0.1% of the martian surface, but transport several global storm equivalents of dust per Mars year, potentially playing a major role in the martian dust cycle. Our global geostatistical analysis challenges wet streak formation models and instead supports dry streak formation, driven by seasonal dust delivery and energetic triggers like wind and meteoritic impacts. We further identify a qualitative, spatiotemporal relation between recurring slope lineae formation, seasonal dust deposition, and dust devil activity. Our findings suggest that modern Mars’ slopes do not commonly experience transient flows of water or brines, implying that streak bearing terrain can be explored without raising planetary protection concerns.,Nature Communications
Irreversible glacier change and trough water for centuries after overshooting 1.5 °C,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-025-02318-w,2025-05-19,Exceeding 1.5 °C of global warming above pre-industrial levels has become a distinct possibility, yet the consequences of such an overshoot for mountain glaciers and their contribution to raising sea levels and impacting water availability are not well understood. Here we show that exceeding and then returning to below 1.5 °C will have irreversible consequences for glacier mass and runoff over centuries. Global climate and glacier simulations project that a 3.0 °C peak-and-decline scenario will lead to 11% more global glacier mass loss by 2500 compared with limiting warming to 1.5 °C without overshooting. In basins where glaciers regrow after peak temperature, glacier runoff reduces further than if the glaciers stabilize, a phenomenon we call ‘trough water’. Half the studied glaciated basins show reduced glacier runoff with overshoot compared with without for decades to centuries after peak warming. These findings underscore the urgency of near-term emissions reductions and limiting temperature overshoot.,Nature Climate Change
Intensive irrigation buffers groundwater declines in key European breadbasket,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-025-00445-4,2025-05-19,The Po Plain in northern Italy is a critical agricultural region and one of the largest water users in the European Union. Recent dry conditions have put future water resource availability into question. This study examines spatio-temporal variations in groundwater storage observed by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites and more than 1,000 groundwater wells from 2002 to 2022. We find that the rate of groundwater storage decline more than doubled from 2015 to 2022 as compared to the 2002–2022 rate. We also show that seasonal and long-term groundwater availability is strongly influenced by irrigation activities. Groundwater storage in irrigated areas is highly correlated to snow accumulation in the Alps and shows more stability as compared to non-irrigated areas, which experience dramatic declines during drought years. This indicates that inefficient irrigation practice, using water largely supplied by snowmelt, recharges underground aquifers and helps maintain high water tables, making aquifers underlying irrigated farmland resilient to the negative consequences of drought. These findings can help guide climate-driven adaptations to irrigation systems that account for the impact on groundwater recharge.,Nature Water
Global patterns of rain-on-snow and its impacts on runoff from past to future projections,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59855-3,2025-05-21,Global warming has induced rain-on-snow (ROS) in cold regions leading to significant consequences on ecosystems and socioeconomic development. However, a global analysis of ROS under historical conditions and future projections following different emissions scenarios, essential for management strategies, is currently lacking. Here, we examine ROS changes and their impacts on the water available for runoff, analyzing historical conditions since 1950 and projecting future trends under SSP245 and SSP585 until 2100. By the end of the century, ROS will predominantly occur in high-latitude and altitude regions such as High Mountain Asia, the Alps, Northern Eurasia, and America with rates up to three times higher than those of the historical conditions. Nonetheless, the increasing rainfall will reduce by more than half the contribution of ROS to the water available for runoff despite its rise. Although regions like the Western United States have historically experienced significant ROS, warming will diminish ROS impacts as they become twice lower due to decreasing snowpack and intensified rainfall.,Nature Communications
Drought frequency, intensity, and exposure have increased due to historical land use and land cover changes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02392-0,2025-05-22,Drought, a marked deficiency of surface water, has a wide adverse impact on the environment, agriculture, and the socio-economy. The global impact of land use changes on drought features and associated exposures to droughts, however, remains largely unknown. In this study, the changes of drought features are estimated by using the model simulations with and without land use change. We show that historical land use changes since 1850, mainly deforestation and crop expansion, has increased the drought frequency, duration, and severity over half of the global land area. Regions with greater activity tend to experience stronger exacerbation of drought events. Owing to their increasing frequency and prolonged duration, populations, croplands and forests are increasingly exposed to drought events, which poses serious potential impacts on human health, agriculture, and forest ecosystems. The enhanced drought events could be substantially alleviated by potential reforestation activity. Our results provide useful information for land-management-related policy-making.,Communications Earth & Environment

Importance of fluvial inflows in the intra-lake heterogeneity of surface water temperatures on the Tibetan Plateau,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01083-z,2025-05-24,Lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are highly responsive to environmental change. Spatiotemporal variations in the lake surface water temperature (LSWT) significantly impact regional ecosystem stability, carbon cycling, and regional climate. However, due to limited observations, the intra-lake heterogeneity of LSWT and its driving forces remain unclear. By employing multi-source datasets, especially observation-constrained LSWT and lake inflow data, along with the random forest method, we analyzed three TP lakes (Nam Co, Siling Co, and Paiku Co) during 2001‒2019. No evident inter-annual LSWT changes were detected. Lake inflow (up to 40% contribution) was the main driver of LSWT variations from July to November, followed by air temperature. Spatially, LSWT intra-lake heterogeneity varied among lakes, with Siling Co showing the largest difference (nearly 4 °C) in autumn, mainly caused by river inflow locations and lake bathymetry. This study improves our understanding of the spatiotemporal variations of LWST for high-mountain lakes, providing insights for climate-change adaptation and water resources management.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Divergent responses of historic rain-on-snow flood extremes to a warmer climate,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02354-6,2025-05-24,Global warming is altering flood risks induced by rain-on-snow events. However, decision-makers lack guidance on how rain-on-snow induced extreme floods could be altered with warming. Here, storyline analyses using a kilometer-scale land surface model reveal diverse responses of four historically-impactful, decision-relevant rain-on-snow induced extreme flood events over the contiguous U.S. to warming, due to alterations in their water budgets. For the 2017-Feb California floods, runoff first increases and then decreases with warming, peaking under the +3 K scenario, while runoff of the 2017-Jan California floods increases monotonically by ~53%/K. Contrastingly, runoff of the 1996-Jan Mid-Atlantic floods decreases gradually with warming. Despite these differences, warming generally shifts flood-generating regimes along elevation profiles. High elevations could experience notably increased runoff, while low elevations encounter a shift from rain-on-snow-driven to rainfall-dominated runoff. These findings underscore the need for flood control planning to quantify region- and elevation-specific changes in rain-on-snow events in a warmer climate.,Communications Earth & Environment
Human mobility amplifies compound flood risks in coastal urban areas under climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02406-x,2025-05-25,Coastal cities face increasing compound flood risks from human mobility patterns under climate change. In this study, we integrated dynamic population distribution models with numerical hydrodynamic modelling to examine mobility effects on flood risk in Hong Kong’s Kowloon area. We simulated flooding across 75 scenarios with matching rainfall and storm surge return periods (50, 100, 200 years) under current conditions and climate projections for 2060 and 2100 under intermediate and very high emission pathways. We found human mobility causes notable temporal shifts in risk distribution, with commercial areas experiencing higher daytime risk while residential areas face increased nighttime risk. Flood risk decreases with distance from coastlines, showing distinct variations between weekdays and weekends. The Night-Day Risk Ratio reveals weekday differentials ranging from 18.7% to 20.6% with minimal weekend variations, intensifying under future climate projections. These insights inform urban planning and flood management in coastal cities.,Communications Earth & Environment
Integrating human decision-making into a hydrological model to accurately estimate the impacts of agricultural policies,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02325-x,2025-05-25,Agriculture is a major contributor to nutrient pollution that drives eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems. This study integrates hydrological modeling with farmer behavioral analysis to assess the effectiveness of two agricultural conservation practices—cover crops and reduced nitrogen fertilizer application—in reducing nitrate loss from fields in the Tar-Pamlico River Basin of North Carolina. Survey responses from 279 farmers revealed widespread reluctance to adopt conservation practices, particularly strict fertilizer reductions. A hydrological model showed that applying each practice to 25 percent of agricultural land could substantially reduce nitrate export, with cover crops showing greater effectiveness than reduced fertilizer use. However, an integrated socio-hydrological model, which incorporated behavioral responses from farmers, predicted much smaller reductions in nitrate loss due to limited voluntary adoption. Specifically, nitrate reductions were overestimated by a factor of 8 for cover crops and by a factor of 25 for reduced fertilizer application when behavioral responses were excluded. This result highlights a critical limitation of traditional modeling approaches and underscores the importance of integrating human decision-making into environmental policy analysis. By linking policy incentives with both biophysical and social responses, this study offers a more realistic framework for designing cost-effective and impactful agricultural conservation strategies.,Communications Earth & Environment
Monthly hydropower generation data for Western Canada to support Western-US interconnect power system studies,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05098-2,2025-05-28,Hydroelectric power generation in Western Canada significantly contributes to power grid operations of the North American Western Interconnection through substantial generation, some of which is exported to the United States (U.S.). However, the lack of publicly available hydropower generation datasets poses challenges for future market projections and resource adequacy evaluations. We present a simulation-based monthly power system model-ready hydropower generation dataset for 110 facilities in British Columbia and Alberta from 1981 to 2019. These monthly hydropower generation estimates are developed from integrated hydrologic model simulations of runoff and reservoir-operated streamflow, followed by scaling that considers diversion inflow constraints based on hydropower water license information. To address the lack of comparable hydropower generation records, we conduct step-by-step evaluations for simulated runoff, regulated streamflow, and hydropower generation using available observations or estimates. The presented hydropower dataset aims to enhance the representation of hydropower resources in Western Canada, supporting power grid system studies for the Western Interconnection of the U.S. and Canada.,Scientific Data
GODEEEP-hydro: Historical and projected power system ready hydropower data for the United States,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05097-3,2025-05-28,Hydropower is a critical electricity resource in the United States which, in addition to low-cost electricity generation, provides valuable ancillary grid services, and supports the integration of nondispatchable weather-dependent resources (e.g., wind and solar). Despite its value to the grid, there are very few comprehensive datasets available from which to study both historical and future impacts of climate, weather driven energy droughts, and integration of other weather driven generation. In this paper, we present a hydropower generation dataset covering 1,452 hydroelectric plants in the contiguous U.S. The dataset contains monthly and weekly hydropower generation estimates for both historical (1982–2019) and future (2020–2099) periods which includes 4 future climate scenarios. In addition, this dataset provides weekly and monthly constraints such as minimum and maximum power which are particularly useful in power system models which are used to study grid reliability, transmission planning and capacity expansion.,Scientific Data
Global dominance of seasonality in shaping lake-surface-extent dynamics,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09046-3,2025-05-28,Lakes are crucial for ecosystems<sup>1</sup>, greenhouse gas emissions<sup>2</sup> and water resources<sup>3</sup>, yet their surface-extent dynamics, particularly seasonality, remain poorly understood at continental to global scales owing to limitations in satellite observations<sup>4,5</sup>. Although previous studies have focused on long-term changes<sup>6,7,8</sup>, comprehensive assessments of seasonality have been constrained by trade-offs between spatial resolution and temporal resolution in single-source satellite data. Here we show that seasonality is the dominant driver of lake-surface-extent variations globally. By leveraging a deep-learning-based spatiotemporal fusion of MODIS and Landsat-based datasets, combined with high-performance computing, we achieved monthly mapping of 1.4 million lakes (2001–2023). Our approach yielded basin-level median user’s and producer’s accuracies of 93% and 96%, respectively, when validated against the Global Surface Water dataset<sup>7</sup>. Seasonality-dominated lakes constitute 66% of the global lake area and approximately 60% of total lake counts, with over 90% of the world’s population residing in regions where such lakes prevail. During seasonality-induced extreme events, the impacts can exceed the combined magnitude of 23-year long-term changes and regular seasonal variations, doubling the contraction of 42% of shrinking lakes and fully offsetting the expansion of 45% of growing lakes. These results uncover previously hidden seasonal dynamics that are crucial for understanding hydrospheric responses to environmental changes<sup>9</sup>, protecting lacustrine systems<sup>10,11,12</sup> and improving global climate models<sup>13,14</sup>. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating seasonality into future research and suggest that advancements in the fusion of multisource remote-sensing data offer a promising path forward.,Nature
Global disparities in rural and urban population exposure to compound drought and heatwave events,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01025-9,2025-05-31,The high occurrence of compound drought and heatwave events (CDHWs), driven by global climate change, poses a serious threat to humanity. However, their impacts on rural and urban populations remain unclear. This study analyzed CDHWs exposure in both rural and urban populations and found that the number of people chronically exposed to CDHWs has shown a clear upward trend over time. From 1901 to 2021, rural populations experienced 2.5 times the total exposure to CDHWs compared to urban populations. Over the past three decades, however, urban populations have experienced significantly higher exposure and a faster rate of increase than rural populations. Regionally, rural populations in Asia, North America, and Africa accounted for 41.06, 16.51, and 13.69% of the total global rural population exposure, respectively, while urban populations in Asia, North America, and Europe accounted for 32.31, 18.70, and 16.85% of global urban exposure, respectively. The climate-population interactive effects have been the dominant factors driving recent changes in population exposure. Our findings contribute to the risk assessment of CDHWs at both global and regional levels and provide reliable information for disaster prevention and mitigation strategies.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science

We also report the accuracy of snow depth measurements in shallow boreal forest and Arctic tundra snowpack and share considerations in developing the consistent and repeatable snow depth data collection procedures. Snow depth measurements and technical validation described in this paper can serve as a robust product for testing snow remote sensing techniques, and for providing a reference dataset for climatological and hydrological studies.,Scientific Data
Landscape controls on water availability limit revegetation after artisanal gold mining in the Peruvian Amazon,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02332-y,2025-06-02,Deforestation from artisanal, small-scale gold mining is transforming large regions of the tropics, from lush rainforest to barren collections of tailings and ponds. Natural forest regeneration is slow due to dramatic soil changes, and existing reforestation strategies are failing. Here we combine remote sensing, electrical resistivity imaging, and measurements of soil properties to characterize post-mining areas in the Madre de Dios region, Peru. We find that the post-mining landscape has dramatically changed water infiltration dynamics, driving decreases in subsurface water availability and presenting a major barrier to revegetation. Mining tailings are extremely hydraulically conductive, allowing for 14.76 m day<sup>−1</sup> infiltration relative to 0.074 m day<sup>−1</sup> in primary forest soils, leading to lower average soil moisture and extreme temperatures (60 °C). Electrical resistivity imaging reveals a highly resistive, 1.5–2 m deep layer of dry sand across the mining landscape. Areas close to the water table (e.g., pond edges) show higher soil moisture, lower temperatures, and greater natural regeneration compared to topographically elevated tailings. Our results suggest that access to water should be prioritized when targeting reforestation sites, potentially requiring large-scale geomorphological reconfiguration. As gold mining is expected to expand, responsible practices and remediation strategies must account for the critical yet often overlooked role of water.,Communications Earth & Environment
Flash drought impacts on global ecosystems amplified by extreme heat,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-025-01719-y,2025-06-02,Flash droughts—characterized by their rapid onset—can cause devastating socioeconomic and agricultural damage. During such events, soil moisture depletion is driven not only by precipitation shortages but also by the elevated atmospheric moisture demand arising due to extreme heat. However, the role of extreme heat in shaping the evolution of flash droughts and their ecological impacts remains uncertain. Here we investigate the processes involved by analysing global reanalysis data from 1950 to 2022. We find that, when flash droughts are accompanied by extreme heat, they exhibit 6.7–90.8% higher severity and 8.3–114.3% longer recovery time than flash droughts without extreme heat. The presence of extreme heat during flash droughts accelerates soil moisture drawdown over high latitudes, where wet soils and enhanced radiation foster evapotranspiration. By contrast, it slows the absolute onset speed in subtropical transitional climate zones owing to evapotranspiration throttling. Our machine learning approach further reveals that hot flash droughts lead to sharper declines in ecosystem productivity, particularly in croplands, thereby threatening global food security. These findings underscore the pressing need for enhanced infrastructure and ecosystem resilience to hot flash droughts in a warming future.,Nature Geoscience
Land-based sensors reveal high frequency of coastal flooding,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02326-w,2025-06-02,Coastal flooding is occurring more frequently due to global sea-level rise, among other factors. However, current understanding of coastal flood frequency and sea-level rise impacts is predominantly based on tide gauges, which do not measure water levels on land. Here, we present data from a novel network of land-based flood sensors in the state of North Carolina, USA. We demonstrate that tide-gauge data are poor indicators of flooding: floods occur 26–128 days annually, an order of magnitude greater than what regional tide gauges suggest in some places. Improving the accuracy of coastal flood measures is critical for identifying the impacts of sea-level rise and developing effective adaptation strategies.,Communications Earth & Environment
Exacerbating dam-induced fragmentation in China’s river systems,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02416-9,2025-06-03,Damming-induced fragmentation is arguably the most pronounced anthropogenic disturbance of global river systems, yet its spatio-temporal evolution remains poorly understood due to constraints in dam information, particularly in rapidly developing regions like China. Here we establish a spatially and temporally explicit inventory of Chinese riverine reservoirs and assess the long-term trajectory of damming impacts on river fragmentation during 1970–2020. We find that the number of dams rocketed from 1019 to 17,414, promoting a nearly-fourfold rise in total capacity. Consequently, ~62% of the main rivers, accounting for 90% of the total river discharge in China, have become fragmented. In particular, intensified dam construction in the 1980s and early-21st century substantially altered the free-flowing conditions of main rivers in China, including the Yangtze and Yellow rivers. Over five decades, free-flowing main rivers in China decreased by 38.9%, weakening fluvial ecosystems and threatening long-distance migratory fish species. Notably, our fine-resolution results show that small rivers are fragmented at lengths 3-16 times greater than previously reported, revealing the ongoing river fragmentation spreading to fragile high-altitude headwaters. This underscores the urgent need to consider the societal and eco-environmental effects of such a severely fragmented river system, and aligns with the UN SDGs in promoting sustainable practices.,Communications Earth & Environment
Diverse wildfire impacts on river flows across the globe,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02419-6,2025-06-04,Forest fires can significantly impact the hydrological regime of river basins, affecting short-term flood propensity and long-term water resource availability until vegetation is reestablished. While basin-level studies have extensively investigated these impacts, regional and global-scale assessments remain limited. Here we use a comprehensive global dataset of river discharge observations to systematically assess the hydrological response to wildfires for a range of hydrologically homogenous world regions and biomes. Our analysis reveals contrasting hydrological impacts by region, with high-latitude discharge ratios declining by 7.5% and 16% in the first and second year after wildfire, respectively, while Northern mid-latitude regions showing a marginal 3.3% median increase in discharge ratio the first-year post-fire. Sub-tropical and equatorial regions display negative and positive effects, respectively. We further discuss how potential ecological and hydroclimatic factors, along with human river and watershed management, shape these diverse hydrological responses per hydroclimatic region.,Communications Earth & Environment
Old carbon routed from land to the atmosphere by global river systems,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09023-w,2025-06-04,Rivers and streams are an important pathway in the global carbon cycle, releasing carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) from their water surfaces to the atmosphere<sup>1,2</sup>. Until now, CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> emitted from rivers were thought to be predominantly derived from recent (sub-decadal) biomass production and, thus, part of ecosystem respiration<sup>3,4,5,6</sup>. Here we combine new and published measurements to create a global database of the radiocarbon content of river dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>. Isotopic mass balance of our database suggests that 59 ± 17% of global river CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are derived from old carbon (millennial or older), the release of which is linked to river catchment lithology and biome. This previously unrecognized release of old, pre-industrial-aged carbon to the atmosphere from long-term soil, sediment and geologic carbon stores through lateral hydrological routing equates to 1.2 ± 0.3 Pg C year<sup>−1</sup>, similar in magnitude to terrestrial net ecosystem exchange. A consequence of this flux is a greater than expected net loss of carbon from aged organic matter stores on land. This requires a reassessment of the fate of anthropogenic carbon in terrestrial systems and in global carbon cycle budgets and models.,Nature
Warming accelerates global drought severity,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09047-2,2025-06-04,Drought is one of the most common and complex natural hazards affecting the environment, economies and populations globally<sup>1,2,3,4</sup>. However, there are significant uncertainties in global drought trends<sup>4,5,6</sup>, and a limited understanding of the extent to which a key driver, atmospheric evaporative demand (AED), impacts the recent evolution of the magnitude, frequency, duration and areal extent of droughts. Here, by developing an ensemble of high-resolution global drought datasets for 1901–2022, we find an increasing trend in drought severity worldwide. Our findings suggest that AED has increased drought severity by an average of 40% globally. Not only are typically dry regions becoming drier but also wet areas are experiencing drying trends. During the past 5 years (2018–2022), the areas in drought have expanded by 74% on average compared with 1981–2017, with AED contributing to 58% of this increase. The year 2022 was record-breaking, with 30% of the global land area affected by moderate and extreme droughts, 42% of which was attributed to increased AED. Our findings indicate that AED has an increasingly important role in driving severe droughts and that this tendency will likely continue under future warming scenarios.,Nature
Thin and ephemeral snow shapes melt and runoff dynamics in the Peruvian Andes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02379-x,2025-06-05,The snow and glaciers of the Peruvian Andes provide vital water supplies in a region facing water scarcity and substantial glacier change. However, there remains a lack of understanding of snow processes and quantification of the contribution of melt to runoff. Here we apply a distributed glacio-hydrological model over the Rio Santa basin to disentangle the role of the cryosphere in the Andean water cycle. Only at the highest elevations (&gt;5000 m a.s.l.) is the snow cover continuous; at lower elevations, the snowpack is thin and ephemeral, with rapid cycles of snowfall and melt. Due to the large catchment area affected by ephemeral snow, its contribution to catchment inputs is substantial (23% and 38% in the wet and dry season, respectively). Ice melt is crucial in the mid-dry season (up to 44% of inputs). Our results improve estimates of water fluxes and call for further process-based modelling across the Andes.,Communications Earth & Environment
Oceanic drivers of UK summer droughts,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02367-1,2025-06-05,UK droughts are projected to become more frequent under climate change, reinforcing the need to understand their underlying causes. Our study examines oceanic drivers of UK summer droughts and the associated teleconnection pathways. Specifically, we evaluate statistical links between standardized precipitation and streamflow indices for the UK and two North Atlantic Sea surface temperature (SST) patterns which have previously been linked to the influx of freshwater into the subpolar region. Our findings reveal that the North Atlantic SST influences UK hydrology up to 1.5 years in advance by altering the position of the North Atlantic Current, which is coupled to the location of the North Atlantic summer jet stream. The long lead time of this teleconnection pathway can inform UK drought forecasting across seasonal to interannual timescales and ultimately contribute to the advancement of sustainable water resource management in the face of increasing drought risks in the UK.,Communications Earth & Environment
Accelerated shifts from heatwaves to heavy rainfall in a changing climate,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01113-w,2025-06-10,Consecutive heatwave and heavy rainfall (HW‐HR) events are occurring with increasing frequency in a warming climate. The time interval, defined as the duration between the end of a heatwave and the onset of heavy rainfall, affects both environmental conditions and the regional recovery between two consecutive extreme events. However, the dynamics of the transition between consecutive HW-HR events remain poorly understood. In this study, we examine the changes in the time interval of consecutive HW-HR events in China from 1970 to 2019, using meteorological data from over 2000 stations across mainland China. Our results reveal that the time interval has significantly shortened at 24.1% of the stations. This trend is primarily driven by an increased proportion of short-time events (STEs), defined as consecutive events with time intervals within 1–2 days. From 1970 to 2019, the proportion of STEs increased significantly, at a rate of 1.4% per decade. We also find that climate change-induced anomalies in atmospheric variables during the consecutive HW-HR events, especially convective available potential energy, 2 m temperature, and relative humidity, may contribute to this rise in the proportion of STEs. Additionally, our study assesses changes in population exposure to STEs over the past two decades. We find that the area of exposure has increased across more than three-quarters of the country, with the increases in STEs contributing to 65.3% of the overall rise in exposure. Our findings highlight the importance of prioritizing disaster response during consecutive HW-HR events and implementing effective risk management strategies to mitigate population exposure to extreme events.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Perchlorate brine formation from frost at the Viking 2 landing site,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02411-0,2025-06-10,The presence and stability of brines on Mars’s surface remain a significant mystery in planetary exploration. Previous mechanisms proposed for brine formation include melting of ice-salt mixtures and salt deliquescence. However, melting lacks a recharge mechanism, and deliquescence is impeded by Mars’s extreme surface aridity. This study explores an underexplored process: the role of seasonal frost in brine formation. Utilizing meteorological data from the Viking 2 lander—the only mission, with Phoenix, to observe in situ water frost formation—I demonstrate that brines can form over approximately 30 sols at the end of winter as frost sublimates. The stable brines exhibit a water activity upper limit of 0.52, corresponding to the eutectic point of calcium perchlorate, a salt detected in various Martian regions, likely including the Viking 2 landing site. Consequently, I conclude that calcium perchlorate can generate small amounts of liquid brine in contact with frost for brief periods. The seasonal nature of frost suggests these brines recur and may leave long-term imprints. Therefore, frost-covered regions are prime candidates for future habitability and astrobiological exploration.,Communications Earth & Environment
Seamless finer-resolution soil moisture from the synergistic merging of the FengYun-3 satellite series,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05263-7,2025-06-11,In the last years, more satellites with microwave imagers have been launched, making more observations available to obtain soil moisture estimates globally. China’s endeavour has resulted in the launch of the FengYun (FY) passive microwave observations (FY-3B, C, D) capable of filling in global soil moisture data gaps. In this study, we develop a merged soil moisture dataset at a spatial resolution of 0.15° from the FY series which spans 2011 to present time (2020 in this study) by a merging technique that minimizes mean square error (MSE) using the signal-to-noise ratio of the input parent products. Here, we combine the ascending and descending observations from the three satellite observations to obtain sub-daily estimates. Finally, we averaged the merged sub-daily FY soil moisture into daily estimates and gap-fill it using a deep learning interpolation approach to reconstruct the missing days while preserving the characteristics of the Merged FY data. The results of this study aim to provide datasets that meet challenges in using global satellite soil moisture observations.,Scientific Data
Hydrometeorological Network of Namal Valley, Pakistan,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05310-3,2025-06-11,This article describes data collected from a sensor network deployed in the catchment of The Namal Lake, situated in Mianwali district, Pakistan. The lake serves as a reservoir for the Namal Dam. The sensor network consists of 14 unique observation points in a watershed spanning a 425 sq km area. The data includes measurements of precipitation at a resolution of 0.246 mm at all sensor locations and measurements of water level at a 1 mm resolution at 7 locations (including the lake itself). The first sensor installation was made in November 2020 with the last one deployed in July 2022. The associated time series for both variables is generated at a 10-minute sampling frequency. Multiple aggregations of the dataset have been made available at hourly, daily, and monthly timescales. The data can be used for calibrating hydrological models for various applications such as flood prediction, watershed management, and decision-making for reservoir operation. The dataset also contributes to understanding the hydrometeorological processes in similar small catchments at the Monsoon Margin.,Scientific Data

Ice melt is crucial in the mid-dry season (up to 44% of inputs). Our results improve estimates of water fluxes and call for further process-based modelling across the Andes.,Communications Earth & Environment
Oceanic drivers of UK summer droughts,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02367-1,2025-06-05,UK droughts are projected to become more frequent under climate change, reinforcing the need to understand their underlying causes. Our study examines oceanic drivers of UK summer droughts and the associated teleconnection pathways. Specifically, we evaluate statistical links between standardized precipitation and streamflow indices for the UK and two North Atlantic Sea surface temperature (SST) patterns which have previously been linked to the influx of freshwater into the subpolar region. Our findings reveal that the North Atlantic SST influences UK hydrology up to 1.5 years in advance by altering the position of the North Atlantic Current, which is coupled to the location of the North Atlantic summer jet stream. The long lead time of this teleconnection pathway can inform UK drought forecasting across seasonal to interannual timescales and ultimately contribute to the advancement of sustainable water resource management in the face of increasing drought risks in the UK.,Communications Earth & Environment
Accelerated shifts from heatwaves to heavy rainfall in a changing climate,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01113-w,2025-06-10,Consecutive heatwave and heavy rainfall (HW‐HR) events are occurring with increasing frequency in a warming climate. The time interval, defined as the duration between the end of a heatwave and the onset of heavy rainfall, affects both environmental conditions and the regional recovery between two consecutive extreme events. However, the dynamics of the transition between consecutive HW-HR events remain poorly understood. In this study, we examine the changes in the time interval of consecutive HW-HR events in China from 1970 to 2019, using meteorological data from over 2000 stations across mainland China. Our results reveal that the time interval has significantly shortened at 24.1% of the stations. This trend is primarily driven by an increased proportion of short-time events (STEs), defined as consecutive events with time intervals within 1–2 days. From 1970 to 2019, the proportion of STEs increased significantly, at a rate of 1.4% per decade. We also find that climate change-induced anomalies in atmospheric variables during the consecutive HW-HR events, especially convective available potential energy, 2 m temperature, and relative humidity, may contribute to this rise in the proportion of STEs. Additionally, our study assesses changes in population exposure to STEs over the past two decades. We find that the area of exposure has increased across more than three-quarters of the country, with the increases in STEs contributing to 65.3% of the overall rise in exposure. Our findings highlight the importance of prioritizing disaster response during consecutive HW-HR events and implementing effective risk management strategies to mitigate population exposure to extreme events.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Perchlorate brine formation from frost at the Viking 2 landing site,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02411-0,2025-06-10,The presence and stability of brines on Mars’s surface remain a significant mystery in planetary exploration. Previous mechanisms proposed for brine formation include melting of ice-salt mixtures and salt deliquescence. However, melting lacks a recharge mechanism, and deliquescence is impeded by Mars’s extreme surface aridity. This study explores an underexplored process: the role of seasonal frost in brine formation. Utilizing meteorological data from the Viking 2 lander—the only mission, with Phoenix, to observe in situ water frost formation—I demonstrate that brines can form over approximately 30 sols at the end of winter as frost sublimates. The stable brines exhibit a water activity upper limit of 0.52, corresponding to the eutectic point of calcium perchlorate, a salt detected in various Martian regions, likely including the Viking 2 landing site. Consequently, I conclude that calcium perchlorate can generate small amounts of liquid brine in contact with frost for brief periods. The seasonal nature of frost suggests these brines recur and may leave long-term imprints. Therefore, frost-covered regions are prime candidates for future habitability and astrobiological exploration.,Communications Earth & Environment
Seamless finer-resolution soil moisture from the synergistic merging of the FengYun-3 satellite series,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05263-7,2025-06-11,In the last years, more satellites with microwave imagers have been launched, making more observations available to obtain soil moisture estimates globally. China’s endeavour has resulted in the launch of the FengYun (FY) passive microwave observations (FY-3B, C, D) capable of filling in global soil moisture data gaps. In this study, we develop a merged soil moisture dataset at a spatial resolution of 0.15° from the FY series which spans 2011 to present time (2020 in this study) by a merging technique that minimizes mean square error (MSE) using the signal-to-noise ratio of the input parent products. Here, we combine the ascending and descending observations from the three satellite observations to obtain sub-daily estimates. Finally, we averaged the merged sub-daily FY soil moisture into daily estimates and gap-fill it using a deep learning interpolation approach to reconstruct the missing days while preserving the characteristics of the Merged FY data. The results of this study aim to provide datasets that meet challenges in using global satellite soil moisture observations.,Scientific Data
Hydrometeorological Network of Namal Valley, Pakistan,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05310-3,2025-06-11,This article describes data collected from a sensor network deployed in the catchment of The Namal Lake, situated in Mianwali district, Pakistan. The lake serves as a reservoir for the Namal Dam. The sensor network consists of 14 unique observation points in a watershed spanning a 425 sq km area. The data includes measurements of precipitation at a resolution of 0.246 mm at all sensor locations and measurements of water level at a 1 mm resolution at 7 locations (including the lake itself). The first sensor installation was made in November 2020 with the last one deployed in July 2022. The associated time series for both variables is generated at a 10-minute sampling frequency. Multiple aggregations of the dataset have been made available at hourly, daily, and monthly timescales. The data can be used for calibrating hydrological models for various applications such as flood prediction, watershed management, and decision-making for reservoir operation. The dataset also contributes to understanding the hydrometeorological processes in similar small catchments at the Monsoon Margin.,Scientific Data
SC-PREC4SA: A serially complete daily precipitation dataset for South America,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05312-1,2025-06-14,This study introduces the serially complete precipitation dataset for South America (SC-PREC4SA), a daily precipitation dataset (1960-2015) designed to address observational gaps and ensure temporal consistency across diverse climates. The raw dataset underwent quality control, gap-filling, and homogenization procedures. Applied robust quality control highlighted common but also overlooked issues, enhancing data reliability. Gap-filling achieved a mean accuracy of 70 % (60 %) in the prediction on wet/dry days (wet-day magnitude). These metrics highlight the reliability of the gap-filling process, particularly in mixed climates, where station networks are sparse. The homogenization algorithm, focused primarily on wet days, effectively reduced inhomogeneities while preserving precipitation variability across South America. By integrating a unified framework and multiple outputs from 7794 stations, SC-PREC4SA provides a robust dataset that captures daily precipitation patterns with high to moderate accuracy and consistency. It offers a valuable resource for climate research, hydrological modeling, and water resource management, addressing longstanding challenges in precipitation data availability and quality for South America.,Scientific Data
Global spatio-temporal ERA5 precipitation downscaling to km and sub-hourly scale using generative AI,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01103-y,2025-06-15,The spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation significantly impacts human lives. While reanalysis datasets provide consistent long-term global precipitation information that allows investigations of rainfall-driven hazards like larger-scale flooding, they lack the resolution to capture the high spatio-temporal variability of precipitation and miss intense local rainfall events. Here, we introduce spateGAN-ERA5, the first deep learning-based spatio-temporal downscaling of precipitation data on a global scale. SpateGAN-ERA5 enhances ERA5 precipitation data from 24 km and 1 h to 2 km and 10 min, delivering high-resolution rainfall fields with realistic spatio-temporal patterns and accurate rain rate distribution, including extremes. Its computational efficiency enables the generation of a large ensemble of solutions, addressing uncertainties inherent to downscaling challenges and supports practical applicability for generating high-resolution precipitation data for arbitrary ERA5 time periods and regions on demand. Trained solely on data from Germany and validated in the US and Australia, considering diverse climates, including tropical rainfall regimes, spateGAN-ERA5 demonstrates strong generalization, indicating robust global applicability. It fulfills critical needs for high-resolution precipitation data in hydrological and meteorological research.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Groundwater salinization patterns in the Yucatan Peninsula reveal contamination and vulnerability of the karst aquifer,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02456-1,2025-06-16,The Yucatan Peninsula is one of the largest coastal and lowland karst regions worldwide. This groundwater-dependent region is highly vulnerable to contaminants that spread easily due to the karst environment. Here, the spatio-temporal patterns of major ions in 1528 water samples sourced from a government institution suggest the main factors triggering salinization in the aquifer system. The hydrogeochemical analysis, supported by dimensional reduction and network-based clustering, linked one-third of the samples to contamination outbreaks from seawater intrusion, extensive gypsum dissolution in the south, and nitrate pollution in the ubiquitous carbonate aquifer matrix. Temporal variations of water quality indicated changes in regional recharge trends and increasing human impact in recent decades. Moreover, ~23% of water samples from human-use sources exceeded acceptable sulfate and nitrate limits for drinking water purposes. The study underscores the need for continuous water quality monitoring and enhanced regional knowledge to support management plans.,Communications Earth & Environment
Large biases in the frequency of water limitation across Earth system models,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02426-7,2025-06-16,Water availability limits evapotranspiration on land, shaping the energy balance, land carbon uptake, and climate extremes. Despite its importance, Earth system models struggle to capture where and how often water-limited conditions occur. Here we investigate the representation of water limitation and its link to land water storage capacity in simulations from the Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) driven by consistent observational atmospheric forcing. Using observations of remotely sensed solar-induced vegetation fluorescence and terrestrial water storage, together with ecosystem flux data, we find that CMIP6 models overestimate the frequency of water limitation by 14% over land and 26% in the tropics. Model overestimation occurs over 57% of the land area, and 78% in the tropics. These too frequent water-limited conditions are not conclusively linked to a potential underestimation of land water storage capacity in the models, hinting at gaps in how ESMs represent rooting depths, plant water uptake, and plant water-use strategies. Our study highlights the need for model development in these areas, with implications for projections of future climate on land.,Communications Earth & Environment
Land water availability altered by historical land use and land cover change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01111-y,2025-06-18,Anthropogenic land use and land cover changes (LULCC) have profound impacts on land water availability, defined as precipitation (P) minus evapotranspiration (ET), through biophysical pathways. However, such impacts have long been debated mostly due to either the inadequate consideration of the atmospheric feedbacks arising from the changes in circulations and background climate in observation-based studies or unrealistic representation of historical LULCC in idealized-simulation-based studies. To overcome these limitations, we use the latest simulations from multiple Earth system models to investigate the impacts of historical (1850–2014) and future (2015–2100) LULCC on P–ET. Here we show that historical LULCC caused an insignificant reduction in global P–ET, mainly in wet regions. Locally, P–ET tends to decrease (increase) in deforestation (reforestation) regions mainly due to the dominant role of precipitation. Approximately 3.8% of the global land area (5.1 Mkm<sup>2</sup>) even has experienced opposite regime shifts, in which negative (positive) P–ET becomes positive (negative). Under a medium-to-high warming scenario, however, reforestation is projected to decrease P–ET even over reforested areas. This study not only elucidates the hydrological effects of realistic LULCC with atmospheric feedbacks being fully considered, but also highlights that the relative importance of the local effects and atmospheric feedbacks varies with background climate changes. We stress that background climate changes and feedbacks due to LULCC should be considered when planning reforestation and other land-use policies.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Climate-induced losses of surface water and total water storage in Northeast Asia,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02449-0,2025-06-19,Water shortages are intensifying globally due to climate change and human activities. Northeast Asia, with diverse ecosystems and transboundary water systems, is particularly sensitive to these pressures. Yet, the region’s water resource changes and drivers remain largely unknown. Here, we integrate Landsat and Sentinel-2 images, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment and its Follow-On observations, climate and anthropogenic data, finding a net surface water area loss of 16 × 10<sup>3 </sup>km<sup>2</sup> in Far East Russia over 2000−2023, primarily driven by rising temperature and evaporative demand, and a net surface water area gain of 3 × 10<sup>3 </sup>km<sup>2</sup> in Northeast China, primarily driven by increasing precipitation and irrigation infrastructure. Approximately 1004 0.5° gridcells (1.4 × 10<sup>6 </sup>km<sup>2</sup>) have concurrent losses of surface water area and total water storage. Approximately 185 million people reside in watersheds with surface water area or total water storage loss, underscoring the need for sustainable water management under intensifying climate change and human activities.,Communications Earth & Environment
A 2°C warming can double the frequency of extreme summer downpours in the Alps,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01081-1,2025-06-19,Intense short-duration summer rainfall in mountainous areas can trigger a variety of natural hazards, including flash floods, debris flows, and urban floods. Warming is expected to intensify extreme sub-hourly rainfall events in response to an increased atmospheric water vapor content and invigorated storm dynamics. Here, we employ a new physically-based statistical model to estimate the projected intensification of sub-hourly and hourly extreme rainfall across 299 high-mountain Alpine stations in France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and Austria. Analyzing the projected intensification for 10-min rainfall at 1 to 3 °C of warming confirms a general intensification at a rate of 9% °C<sup>−1</sup> over the Alpine region, with a stronger intensification at higher elevations. With a 2 °C increase in average regional temperature relative to the 1991–2020 period, extreme rainfall statistics over the Alps are likely to undergo significant changes, resulting in a two-fold increase in the probability of occurrence of the extreme rainfall levels used for infrastructure design and risk management.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Forty-year hydropower generation reanalysis for Conterminous United States,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05323-y,2025-06-19,First published in 2022, the RectifHyd dataset provides hydrologically consistent estimates of monthly net generation for approximately 1,500 hydropower plants in the United States, addressing a gap in industrial surveys that have collected monthly generation data from only ~10% of plants post-2003. Here we present RectifHydPlus—an extended and enhanced dataset that improves on both the proxy information and temporal downscaling methodology adopted in RectifHyd. In addition to providing updated estimates of historical monthly generation for 590 plants with &gt;10 MW nameplate capacity from 1980 through 2019, RectifHydPlus adds a hydrological control dataset that isolates the influence of historical water availability on generation. The new hydrological control dataset is suited to applications seeking to represent the capabilities of the contemporary fleet subject to historical interannual variability in climate. RectifHydPlus also includes a forty-year, daily-resolution, spill-adjusted water release time series for each dam, allowing users to aggregate generation estimates to the desired temporal resolution.,Scientific Data
CNSW 1.0: Prefectural Reconstruction of China’s Surface Water Resources Using Machine Learning Methods,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05389-8,2025-06-19,A comprehensive and long-term dataset of prefectural surface water resources is crucial for effective water resources management in China. However, there has been a significant gap in the availability of such datasets, with no existing datasets providing comprehensive long-term coverage. To address this gap, we have developed CNSW 1.0, the first long-term (2000–2020) dataset of prefectural surface water resources in China. Utilizing surface water resources data from official water resources bulletins, we employed 14 advanced machine learning models to reconstruct the CNSW 1.0 dataset. The resulting dataset exhibits high accuracy, with an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.98 for total surface water resources and acceptable level of bias across China. CNSW 1.0 not only outperforms existing datasets like CNRD v1.0, GRUN, and ISIMIP in terms of simulation accuracy and spatial distribution but also fills a critical gap in water resources data for China. This dataset is expected to be an invaluable tool for developing more informed water resources management strategies at the administrative level in China, particularly in the context of climate change.,Scientific Data
Dynamics-constrained rainfall projection reveals substantial increase in population exposure to unprecedented floods in the North China Plain,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02457-0,2025-06-19,Understanding the changing flood magnitude and frequency is crucial for managing flood risks. Current flood projections are hindered by uncertain rainfall changes and inadequate representation of spatial-temporal rainfall characteristics from global climate models. Here we develop a framework for flood projection integrating large ensemble climate model outputs and dynamic downscaling simulations. By unveiling the shifting importance of changes in atmospheric circulation and water vapor to rainfall extremes of varying magnitudes, a scaling ratio is derived to constrain rainfall projections from thermodynamics-perturbed experiments. Applying this framework to the North China Plain, we reveal substantial rainfall increases partially attributed to more favorable synoptic conditions. This leads to a nearly fivefold rise in population exposure to moderate and high flood depths (i.e., 0.5 ~ 2 m). The region with heightened flood risk is spatially offset from that with rainfall increases. These findings highlight an urgency for improved flood risk management in the densely populated region.,Communications Earth & Environment
The AIDA 1 km resolution crop-specific rainfed and irrigated areas and green and blue water demands for Italy,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05390-1,2025-06-20,Climate and global changes alter natural resources demand and availability for meeting societal needs. Agricultural water use remains a priority, as agriculture remains the first freshwater consumer. Accurate mapping of irrigated and rainfed crops is crucial in agro-hydrological modelling for water management and policy. Taking Italy as prominent case, we present AIDA (Agricultural Irrigation Demand Analyzer), a set of high-resolution crop-specific maps of rainfed and irrigated areas and water demands. We combine very-high resolution crop-specific landcover datasets with cropland ground data and irrigation intensity maps to derive 1km-resolution maps for rainfed and irrigated crops in the entire Italian territory. A dynamic, spatially distributed agro-hydrological model with state-of-the-art inputs derives evapotranspirative demands partitioned into green water (from precipitation stored as soil moisture) and blue water (from irrigation). Our results have a linear correlation &gt;75% and an error &lt;20% w.r.t. subnational statistics in &gt;80% of the areas. Despite limitations due to inputs, assumptions on hydrological processes and agricultural practices, AIDA complements existing hydrological models and land use datasets for Italy.,Scientific Data
A strategic environmental water rights market for Colorado River reallocation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-025-01585-x,2025-06-20,The Colorado River system is among the world’s most overallocated basins, struggling to supply water to the southwestern United States and Mexico. Consequently, 90% of the basin’s native fish species are endangered, threatened or extinct. Driven by a 24-year megadrought, the United States allocated over US$4 billion for drought mitigation, including water market transactions that pay farms, cities and industries to divert less water across the US Southwest. We developed a model of how strategic water markets can restore imperilled fish habitat, integrating hydrology, ecology, economics and water rights within the river’s headwater state of Colorado. While least-cost water-use reductions improve over one-third of restorable river habitat, strategically spending 8% more nearly triples habitat improvement. Ten transactions attain 26% of that improvement for 1% of the cost. Water markets that do not legally protect conserved water are 29% less cost-effective than markets that do. Overall, strategic investing and legal reforms yield outsized ecological benefits.,Nature Sustainability
Green and blue water response to drought modulated by background climate and vegetation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02476-x,2025-06-20,Drought affects the health of natural and socio-ecological systems by altering green water evapotranspiration and blue water runoff. However, the global patterns of green and blue water responses to drought remain unclear. Here we quantified drought using root-zone soil moisture reductions and examined the resulting water deficits across different climatic and vegetation conditions. We show that drought generally reduces both evapotranspiration and runoff globally, though with pronounced spatiotemporal variability. In high-latitude humid regions, drought can initially enhance evapotranspiration, whereas runoff responds more rapidly and declines consistently throughout drought periods. Furthermore, drought reduces runoff more than evapotranspiration in humid regions, but the reverse pattern occurs in arid regions. Compared to other vegetation types, forests exhibit smaller drought-induced reductions in evapotranspiration but greater reductions in runoff. These results underscore the importance of considering background climate and vegetation when assessing drought’s hydrological impacts, with important implications for ecohydrological understanding and water resource management.,Communications Earth & Environment
Wildfires drive multi-year water quality degradation over the western United States,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02427-6,2025-06-23,Wildfires can dramatically alter water quality, resulting in severe implications for human and freshwater systems. However, regional-scale assessments of these impacts are often limited by data scarcity. Here, we unify observations from 1984–2021 in 245 burned watersheds across the western United States, comparing post-fire signals to baseline levels from 293 unburned basins. Organic carbon and phosphorus exhibit significantly elevated levels (p ≤ 0.05) in the first 1–5 years post-fire, while nitrogen and sediment show significant increases up to 8 years post-fire. During peak post-fire response years, average carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations are 3–103 times pre-fire levels, and sediment 19–286 times pre-fire concentrations. Higher responses are linked with greater forested and developed areas, which respectively explain up to 31 and 33% of inter-basin response variability. Overall, this analysis provides strong evidence of multi-year water quality degradation following wildfires in the western United States and highlights the influence of basin and wildfire features. These insights may aid water managers in preparation efforts, increasing resilience of water systems to wildfire impacts.,Communications Earth & Environment
Response time of global deltas to changes in fluvial sediment supply,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60531-9,2025-07-01,Fluvial sediment supply supports global delta growth, yet the relationship between these two key variables remains difficult to verify for modern river deltas. Part of the complication might be that deltas are slow to adjust to changes in fluvial sediment supply. To test this hypothesis, here we analyze yearly time series of fluvial sediment supply and delta land area changes for 60 major deltas through 1990–2020. Cross-correlations show that, globally averaged, changes in delta growth rate lag 6 years behind fluctuations in fluvial sediment supply. For the 24 deltas with increased sediment supply, the lag time of land change rates was reduced to 1 year; while the 36 deltas supplied with lower fluvial sediment loads lagged by 6 years. High sediment availability in river-dominated deltas leads to a quicker response of delta land area to upstream supply changes, and deltas with stronger tidal dominance have a subdued response with long lag times. Our findings here highlight the high vulnerability of deltas and their ecosystems to changing external drivers.,Nature Communications
The ocean flows downhill near the seafloor and recirculates upward above,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61027-2,2025-07-01,The ocean’s circulation redistributes heat, salt, biota, dissolved gases, microplastics, and sediments on Earth. The abyssal ocean, in the lowest 1000 m above the seafloor, moves on average with the deeper seafloor to its left in the Northern Hemisphere and to its right in the Southern Hemisphere. This finding has received little attention and its consequences for the abyssal vertical circulation have remained largely unexplored. Here, we show, using current-meter measurements and numerical simulations, that the interior flow, \({{{\mathcal{O}}}}\)(100 m) - \({{{\mathcal{O}}}}\)(1000 m) above the seafloor, is deflected within the bottom boundary layer, the lowest \({{{\mathcal{O}}}}\)(10 m), into a widespread downhill flow. This flow intensifies with the steepness of the seafloor. We further reveal that typical local changes in seafloor steepness lead to a shallow divergence and a deep convergence of this downhill flow. These are connected by an overlying upward recirculation forming closed overturning cells that extend on average over the lowest 1000 m of the ocean. Our study improves the understanding of the oceanic abyssal circulation and the climate-relevant overturning. Future research should focus on quantifying the transports of heat, particles, and dissolved chemicals associated with these abyssal slope overturning cells.,Nature Communications
Different geomorphic processes control suspended sediment and bedload export from glaciers,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60776-4,2025-07-01,Ongoing cryospheric change has modified sediment export from glacierized catchments substantially, with significant implications for ecosystems and downstream users, notably hydropower companies. Sediment is exported either as finer sediment in suspension or as coarser bedload with intermittent contact between sediment and the bed. To date, the difficulty in observing subglacial bedload transport limits the understanding of the physical processes associated with evacuating bedload compared with suspended load. We elucidate the factors controlling sediment export by inverting a physically-based numerical model of subglacial sediment production and sediment transport with suspended sediment and continuous bedload discharge records from an Alpine glacier. Comparable quantities of suspended sediment and bedload are exported, and model results suggest that both rely on the availability of sediment for transport. Yet, bedload export in subglacial channels also depends on particular hydraulic conditions, notably channel shape and hydraulic roughness. This makes exporting bedload-sized particles inefficient compared to fine-grained sediment. As a result, subglacial hydraulics should be explicitly considered when examining bedload export processes, and suspended and bedload transport should be considered separately. Inefficient bedload evacuation by melt water implies that glacial erosion may only continue when non-fluvial mechanisms evacuate sediment, such as sediment entrainment into the ice.,Nature Communications
Finer resolutions and targeted process representations in earth system models improve hydrologic projections and hydroclimate impacts,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01134-5,2025-07-01,Earth system models inform water policy and interventions, but knowledge gaps in hydrologic representations limit the credibility of projections and impacts assessments. The literature does not provide conclusive evidence that incorporating higher resolutions, comprehensive process models, and latest parameterization schemes, will result in improvements. We compare hydroclimate representations and runoff projections across two generations of Coupled Modeling Intercomparison Project (CMIP) models, specifically, CMIP5 and CMIP6, with gridded runoff from Global Runoff Reconstruction (GRUN) and ECMWF Reanalysis V5 (ERA5) as benchmarks. Our results show that systematic embedding of the best available process models and parameterizations, together with finer resolutions, improve runoff projections with uncertainty characterizations in 30 of the largest rivers worldwide in a mechanistically explainable manner. The more skillful CMIP6 models suggest that, following the mid-range SSP370 emissions scenario, 40% of the rivers will exhibit decreased runoff by 2100, impacting 850 million people.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Asymmetric shifts in precipitation due to urbanization across global cities,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61053-0,2025-07-01,Urbanization alters precipitation patterns by modifying thermal, dynamic, and chemical processes in the atmosphere. However, its effect on precipitation regimes, particularly at the sub-daily scale, is poorly understood. In this work, we use a high-resolution, spatially continuous satellite precipitation dataset to examine urbanization-induced shifts across precipitation intensities over global cities. We show that urbanization generally causes asymmetric shifts, increasing lower-intensity events and decreasing higher-intensity ones, with distinct patterns in tropical monsoon regions. These shifts, primarily driven by changes in event frequency, lead to reduced precipitation variability in urban areas, particularly in temperate cities and those exhibiting higher urbanization levels. Sub-daily analysis reveals that lower-intensity precipitation most notably increases in the early morning, while higher-intensity events decrease in the late afternoon, dampening diurnal precipitation variability. These findings offer important observational evidence of how urbanization alters precipitation regimes and highlight the need for adaptive urban water management strategies.,Nature Communications
Mapping global floods with 10 years of satellite radar data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60973-1,2025-07-01,Floods cause extensive global damage annually, making effective monitoring essential. While satellite observations have proven invaluable for flood detection and tracking, comprehensive global flood datasets spanning extended time periods remain scarce. In this study, we introduce a deep learning flood detection model that leverages the cloud-penetrating capabilities of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery, enabling consistent flood extent mapping through cloud cover and in both day and night conditions. By applying this model to 10 years of SAR data, we create a unique, longitudinal global flood extent dataset with predictions unaffected by cloud coverage, offering comprehensive and consistent insights into historically flood-prone areas over the past decade. We use our model predictions to identify historically flood-prone areas in Ethiopia and demonstrate real-time disaster response capabilities during the May 2024 floods in Kenya. Additionally, our longitudinal analysis reveals potential increasing trends in global flood extent over time, although further validation is required to explore links to climate change. To maximize impact, we provide public access to both our model predictions and a code repository, empowering researchers and practitioners worldwide to advance flood monitoring and enhance disaster response strategies.,Nature Communications
Climate and anthropogenic activities control the concentrations of copper, zinc, cadmium and chromium in global inland waters,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02508-6,2025-07-03,Pollution by heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr) in global inland waters poses significant threats to freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem function, yet the global patterns and drivers of heavy metals remain poorly explored. Here, assessing using 11,573 data points collected from 514 peer-reviewed publications, key advances include: (1) quantification of median concentrations in global inland waters (Cu: 8.38, Zn: 30.00, Cd: 0.53, and Cr: 7.00 μg L<sup>−1</sup>), providing global-scale reference values to contextualize local water quality assessments; (2) anthropogenic activities, temperature, actual evapotranspiration, precipitation and runoff dominantly control the concentrations of heavy metals in inland waters, and (3) global heavy metal pollution hotspots were established, revealing significantly elevated concentrations in West and South Asia and Africa, followed by South America. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of inland water for Cu, Zn, Cd, and Cr, offering a scientific foundation for targeting pollution control in vulnerable regions under climate change.,Communications Earth & Environment

Comparable quantities of suspended sediment and bedload are exported, and model results suggest that both rely on the availability of sediment for transport. Yet, bedload export in subglacial channels also depends on particular hydraulic conditions, notably channel shape and hydraulic roughness. This makes exporting bedload-sized particles inefficient compared to fine-grained sediment. As a result, subglacial hydraulics should be explicitly considered when examining bedload export processes, and suspended and bedload transport should be considered separately. Inefficient bedload evacuation by melt water implies that glacial erosion may only continue when non-fluvial mechanisms evacuate sediment, such as sediment entrainment into the ice.,Nature Communications
Finer resolutions and targeted process representations in earth system models improve hydrologic projections and hydroclimate impacts,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01134-5,2025-07-01,Earth system models inform water policy and interventions, but knowledge gaps in hydrologic representations limit the credibility of projections and impacts assessments. The literature does not provide conclusive evidence that incorporating higher resolutions, comprehensive process models, and latest parameterization schemes, will result in improvements. We compare hydroclimate representations and runoff projections across two generations of Coupled Modeling Intercomparison Project (CMIP) models, specifically, CMIP5 and CMIP6, with gridded runoff from Global Runoff Reconstruction (GRUN) and ECMWF Reanalysis V5 (ERA5) as benchmarks. Our results show that systematic embedding of the best available process models and parameterizations, together with finer resolutions, improve runoff projections with uncertainty characterizations in 30 of the largest rivers worldwide in a mechanistically explainable manner. The more skillful CMIP6 models suggest that, following the mid-range SSP370 emissions scenario, 40% of the rivers will exhibit decreased runoff by 2100, impacting 850 million people.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Asymmetric shifts in precipitation due to urbanization across global cities,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61053-0,2025-07-01,Urbanization alters precipitation patterns by modifying thermal, dynamic, and chemical processes in the atmosphere. However, its effect on precipitation regimes, particularly at the sub-daily scale, is poorly understood. In this work, we use a high-resolution, spatially continuous satellite precipitation dataset to examine urbanization-induced shifts across precipitation intensities over global cities. We show that urbanization generally causes asymmetric shifts, increasing lower-intensity events and decreasing higher-intensity ones, with distinct patterns in tropical monsoon regions. These shifts, primarily driven by changes in event frequency, lead to reduced precipitation variability in urban areas, particularly in temperate cities and those exhibiting higher urbanization levels. Sub-daily analysis reveals that lower-intensity precipitation most notably increases in the early morning, while higher-intensity events decrease in the late afternoon, dampening diurnal precipitation variability. These findings offer important observational evidence of how urbanization alters precipitation regimes and highlight the need for adaptive urban water management strategies.,Nature Communications
Mapping global floods with 10 years of satellite radar data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60973-1,2025-07-01,Floods cause extensive global damage annually, making effective monitoring essential. While satellite observations have proven invaluable for flood detection and tracking, comprehensive global flood datasets spanning extended time periods remain scarce. In this study, we introduce a deep learning flood detection model that leverages the cloud-penetrating capabilities of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery, enabling consistent flood extent mapping through cloud cover and in both day and night conditions. By applying this model to 10 years of SAR data, we create a unique, longitudinal global flood extent dataset with predictions unaffected by cloud coverage, offering comprehensive and consistent insights into historically flood-prone areas over the past decade. We use our model predictions to identify historically flood-prone areas in Ethiopia and demonstrate real-time disaster response capabilities during the May 2024 floods in Kenya. Additionally, our longitudinal analysis reveals potential increasing trends in global flood extent over time, although further validation is required to explore links to climate change. To maximize impact, we provide public access to both our model predictions and a code repository, empowering researchers and practitioners worldwide to advance flood monitoring and enhance disaster response strategies.,Nature Communications
Climate and anthropogenic activities control the concentrations of copper, zinc, cadmium and chromium in global inland waters,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02508-6,2025-07-03,Pollution by heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr) in global inland waters poses significant threats to freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem function, yet the global patterns and drivers of heavy metals remain poorly explored. Here, assessing using 11,573 data points collected from 514 peer-reviewed publications, key advances include: (1) quantification of median concentrations in global inland waters (Cu: 8.38, Zn: 30.00, Cd: 0.53, and Cr: 7.00 μg L<sup>−1</sup>), providing global-scale reference values to contextualize local water quality assessments; (2) anthropogenic activities, temperature, actual evapotranspiration, precipitation and runoff dominantly control the concentrations of heavy metals in inland waters, and (3) global heavy metal pollution hotspots were established, revealing significantly elevated concentrations in West and South Asia and Africa, followed by South America. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of inland water for Cu, Zn, Cd, and Cr, offering a scientific foundation for targeting pollution control in vulnerable regions under climate change.,Communications Earth & Environment
Rapid increases in satellite-observed ice sheet surface meltwater production,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-025-02364-4,2025-07-04,Surface meltwater production influences the contribution of ice sheets to global sea-level change. Ice-sheet-wide meltwater production has thus far primarily been quantified by regional climate models. Here we present a 31-year (1992–2023) time series of daily satellite-observed surface melt flux for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. The annual meltwater volume in Greenland has significantly increased, with intensified melt in the northern basins dominated by a negative North Atlantic Oscillation and elevated melt flux in western basins driven by the decline in Arctic sea-ice. In East Antarctica, high melt rates since 2000 are attributed to warm air incursions from the Southern Ocean due to anomalous atmospheric circulations associated with a negative Southern Annular Mode and the recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole. This region, previously less prone to surface melt, has become a melt hotspot, potentially leading to meltwater ponding and future ice shelf destabilization.,Nature Climate Change
A physically consistent dataset of water-energy-carbon fluxes across the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere Continuum,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05386-x,2025-07-04,Hight-quality and Long-term measurements of land-atmosphere fluxes are vital for climate monitoring and Land Surface models (LSMs) benchmarking. Eddy covariance provides key in-situ data for theory and LSMs evaluation, but most flux towers lack continuous soil-plant-atmosphere measurements. Here, we present a long-term global dataset of water, energy and carbon fluxes, along with the corresponding above and below-ground hydrological, photosynthetic, and radiative data derived from the STEMMUS-SCOPE model simulations at 170 sites. In-situ observed fluxes data from PLUMBER2 and soil moisture (SM) data from FLUXNET2015 are employed to validate the effectiveness of the STEMMUS-SCOPE dataset. Results demonstrate that, without site-specific model tuning or calibration, and driven solely by global parameters and forcing datasets, simulated net radiation, latent heat flux, sensible heat flux, gross primary production, net ecosystem exchange, and SM datasets consistently agree with available in-situ measurements (median KGE: −0.03 to 0.80; median R<sup>2</sup>: 0.46 to 0.97; median rRMSE: 4.09% to 29.11%). This dataset supplements the existing ecosystem flux and SM network, enhancing our understanding of ecosystem functioning.,Scientific Data
Spatial transmission of resilience loss in deltaic dynamic systems,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02519-3,2025-07-05,River and tidal dynamics regulate delta water levels, underpinning their ecological and socio-economic stability. Deltaic water level resilience, the capacity to recover from disturbances, is vital amid growing climate and human pressures, necessitating a robust method to quantify and monitor it. Here we define water level resilience as the rate of water level recovery post-hydrodynamic disturbances. We quantify resilience trends using autocorrelation and propose a high-dimensional resilience transmission method based on a vine Copula model to estimate the spatial propagation of resilience loss across subsystems. Applying this framework to the Pearl River Delta in China reveals spatial heterogeneity and inter-subsystem transmission of resilience loss driven by anthropogenic activities. Our approach can be extended to other major deltas, despite differing hydrodynamic and human impacts. The findings underscore the need for tailored management strategies addressing specific drivers and subsystem interactions, offering critical insights into the global delta preservation amid escalating environmental challenges.,Communications Earth & Environment
Intensifying tropical cyclones in the Arabian Sea replenish depleting aquifers,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02493-w,2025-07-08,Tropical cyclones intensified globally in recent decades, delivering extreme precipitation deeper inland. While much research has focused on the role of climate change in tropical cyclone intensification, less is known about their contribution to groundwater recharge, especially in arid regions where freshwater is scarce and aquifers are being depleted. Here we quantify cyclone-driven groundwater recharge across the Arabian Peninsula from 2002 to 2021 using satellite-based total water storage and hydrodynamic modeling. Findings show that cyclones contributed up to 60% of total precipitation in the southern Arabian Peninsula. Cyclone Mekunu (2018) alone delivered 30 km<sup>3</sup> of precipitation inland, resulting in a net groundwater recharge of 3.2 ± 1.2 km<sup>3</sup> in the Najd subbasin. These findings reveal that tropical cyclones play a crucial role in replenishing groundwater resources in arid regions. Our approach provides a framework for quantifying recharge in ungauged arid basins worldwide, offering valuable insights for climate-resilient water resource management.,Communications Earth & Environment
Bimodality in subaqueous dune height suggests flickering behavior at high flow,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61248-5,2025-07-09,River bedforms influence fluvial hydraulics by altering bed roughness. With increasing flow velocity, the sand-bedded river transitions from a flat bed to ripples, dunes, and an upper stage plane bed. Although prior research notes increased bedform height variation with flow strength and rapid shifts between bed configurations, the latter remains understudied. Here, we reveal flickering between low and high dune heights for transport stages exceeding 18, based on data from earlier experiments and a complementary experiment. Above this transport stage, the second mode in the dune height distributions becomes increasingly distinctive, suggesting a critical transition. The emergence of the second mode is potentially triggered by temporal changes in suspended sediment concentration impacting turbulence, or might result from dune kinematics enabling larger dunes to grow and persist longer. This flickering behavior challenges the adequacy of a single snapshot to capture the system’s bed geometry, impacting field measurements and experimental designs, and questions a classical equilibrium equation in geomorphology. Our study calls for further research to understand and quantify flickering behavior in sediment beds at high transport stages.,Nature Communications
SMRFR: A global multilayer soil moisture dataset generated using Random Forest from multi-source data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05511-w,2025-07-09,Accurate and continuous monitoring of soil moisture (SM) is crucial for a wide range of applications in agriculture, hydrology, and climate modelling. In this study, we present a novel machine learning (ML) based framework for generating a continuously updated, multilayer global SM dataset: SMRFR (Soil Moisture via Random Forest Regression). Leveraging publicly available reanalysis and remote sensing data, SMRFR provides daily SM estimates at five soil layers (0–5, 5–10, 10–30, 30–50 and 50–100 cm) with a spatial resolution of 9 km, covering the period from 2000 to 2023. Evaluation results demonstrate that SMRFR effectively captures both spatial and temporal SM variability. It also exhibits strong generalization capacity, successfully transferring knowledge across continents and accurately capturing transient and seasonal SM dynamics following rainfall events. SMRFR achieved an unbiased root mean square error of 0.0339 m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>3</sup> on the validation set. Our novel SM dataset offers a basis and valuable reference for agricultural, hydrological, and ecological research, enabling improved analysis and modelling of SM dynamics at regional to global scales.,Scientific Data
Synthesis of a global daily average gapless land surface temperature dataset from 2003 to 2018,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05498-4,2025-07-10,Land Surface Temperature (LST) plays a crucial role in research in the fields of energy balance, hydrology, meteorology, geography, and ecology, serving as a significant input indicator of widespread interest. Remote sensing LST is one of the most widely used and applied methods. However, due to factors such as cloud, remote sensing LST data often exhibit a significant number of missing values, which can pose challenges to its application. This study proposes a gapless LST product with a spatial resolution of one kilometer and a temporal resolution of one day, generated by integrating two remote sensing datasets (1 km daily mean land surface temperature (DMLST) dataset by Zhan et al. and 1 km DMLST dataset by Liu et al.) and two reanalysis datasets (GLDAS and ERA5-Land). The validation results show that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the synthesized product is about 2 K, which is better than the other four products, the accuracy of RMSE has increased by 0.4–0.6 K, and it have shown significant improvements in arid and cold regions.,Scientific Data
A nationwide dataset of stable isotopes in meteoric and terrestrial water across Peru,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05413-x,2025-07-12,Water Stable Isotopes (δ<sup>18</sup>O, δ<sup>2</sup>H) are valuable tools for tracing sources and interactions in the water cycle, providing important information dedicated to understanding physical mechanisms related to global climate. Despite their significance, the topic of isotopic research in South America has been hindered by limited data. To address this gap, we launched a national-level water stable isotope dataset covering different water sources in Peru (WSI-PeruDB). The dataset contains curated in-house data and incorporates previously published records from various locations collected between 2000 and 2021. The WSIPeruDB dataset is composed of 489 water collection sites and allows a comprehensive use of the dataset by implementing standardized metadata templates containing essential geographical information such as latitude, longitude, and altitude (from sea level to 5000 m a.s.l), and sampling information such as sample type (e.g. groundwater, precipitation, river, spring, and others) and sampling frequency (e.g. biweekly, daily, monthly).

Surface waters in socially vulnerable areas are disproportionately under-monitored for nutrients in the US South Atlantic-Gulf region,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-025-00460-5,2025-07-15,This study investigates whether active water quality monitoring stations are proportionately distributed across communities of varying social vulnerability. We specifically focus on nutrient monitoring of surface waters in the South Atlantic-Gulf region, a water-rich area with wide-ranging land uses and communities that span the social vulnerability spectrum. We used 2018–2022 data from the US Water Quality Portal to compare station locations to metrics from the US Centers for Disease Control Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and hydrography from the US Geological Survey. Statistical analyses revealed a substantial imbalance in the distribution of active monitoring station placements, with more monitoring stations in lower vulnerability areas and fewer in high vulnerability areas, and patterns that vary by state. Stations were clustered in areas of similar SVI values; areas were less likely to be monitored if they were near tracts with differing SVI values.,Nature Water
A Global Multi-Sensor Dataset of Surface Water Indices from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Satellite Measurements,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05562-z,2025-07-17,Spatiotemporal mapping of surface water extent constitutes a valuable dataset for the management of water resources, the monitoring of flood- and drought-affected areas, and the conservation of wetlands and freshwater ecosystems. Surface water indices, derived from optical satellite data, serve as effective indicators for estimating surface water coverage. However, global-scale datasets featuring high-resolution surface water mapping using multiple water indices remain scarce and constrained in temporal and spatial scope. Here, we present monthly surface-water maps derived from three water indices, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified NDWI (MNDWI), and Water Index 2015 (WI2015), utilizing high-resolution earth observation satellite data from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 for the period January 2019 to December 2021. These maps will be regularly updated as new satellite data become available. These water index mappings provide a baseline for projecting the distribution of surface-water resources and deliver critical information for the sustainable management of surface water resources under the challenges posed by the global climate change.,Scientific Data
A Machine Learning-Reconstructed Dataset of River Discharge, Temperature, and Heat Flux into the Arctic Ocean,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05582-9,2025-07-17,Arctic rivers deliver 11% of the global river discharge volume into the Arctic Ocean, influencing ocean circulation, sea ice, and coastal ecosystems. Our understanding of these patterns is limited by substantial data gaps. To address this, we present the Reconstructed Arctic-draining river DIscharge and Temperature (RADIT) dataset, a comprehensive record of reconstructed daily discharge, temperature, and heat flux for 25 major Arctic rivers from 1950 to 2023. Based on machine learning regression methods and ERA5-Land reanalysis data, we designed distinct reconstruction frameworks for discharge and temperature, considering the different characteristics of the observational data. We achieved high reconstruction accuracy, with median Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values of 0.861 for discharge and 0.906 for temperature. The RADIT dataset, with extensive spatial and temporal coverage, is a valuable resource for understanding Arctic hydrology and its response to climate change. It will improve Arctic freshwater budget quantification, climate model calibrations, and assessments of river impacts on the Arctic Ocean, enhancing our understanding of the role of the Arctic Ocean in the global climate system.,Scientific Data
Alternative rainfall storylines for the Western European July 2021 floods from ensemble boosting,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02386-y,2025-07-08,In July 2021, a cut-off low-pressure system brought extreme rainfall to Western Europe, leading to flooding that caused loss of life and infrastructure damage. Here, we use ensemble boosting to investigate alternative storylines of the event, given the observed dynamical situation. Using a fully coupled free-running climate model, we identify atmospheric flow analogues of the 2021 event in an initial-condition large ensemble. These analogues are re-initialised with slightly perturbed atmospheric initial conditions to generate physically plausible alternative storylines. The storylines are used to investigate how a potentially worse event could have unfolded given the same large-scale dynamics. We identify rainfall events with longer persistence and larger extent, yet the observed event appears to be towards the upper end of what is plausible in the current climate. Such storylines can be used to prepare for possible future events, helping society to imagine dangerous, but plausible, scenarios.,Communications Earth & Environment

Increased dependency of regional drought termination on landfalling tropical cyclones,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02564-y,2025-07-18,Landfalling tropical cyclones frequently occur with strong winds and heavy rainfall, providing substantial water resources. The positive impacts of tropical cyclones on drought alleviation and termination remain unknown. Here, we estimate the dependency of drought terminations on tropical cyclone rainfall through frequency analyses and event coincidence analysis. Results show that ~3% of the tropical cyclone-affected areas have experienced multiple drought events terminated by tropical cyclone rainfall from 1999 to 2021. Globally, tropical cyclone-terminated drought events averaged 1.12 annually and increased significantly by 1.92% per year. Increases were especially significant in the Arabian Peninsula, South Asia, and the northwest of Australia. Rainfall produced by tropical cyclones alleviates drought events more drastically than that by other weather systems, such as fronts, mesoscale convective systems, and atmospheric rivers. These findings underscore the adaptation of precipitation changes due to shifts in the timing and weather systems under a warming climate.,Communications Earth & Environment
Historical changes in overtopping probability of dams in the United States,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59536-1,2025-07-21,With concerns about aging dams and nonstationary changes in hydrologic extremes (e.g., flooding), questions arise about whether existing dams may be at risk of failure and pose threats to society. Here, we analyzed 33 dams across the United States to investigate temporal trends in dam overtopping probabilities of annual maximum dam water levels. These dams were selected because of the availability of public domain long-term time series of uncontrolled water levels (50 years or longer). We applied updated stationary frequency analyses using generalized extreme value distributions on 30-year rolling periods from 1973 to 2022. The results revealed an overall increasing trend in the number of dams exhibiting critical overtopping probabilities (i.e., low, moderate and high) alongside a decline in the number of non-critical overtopping probabilities (i.e., very low) over time. This approach uncovered overtopping probabilities that traditional analyses based solely on dam water levels could not reveal. We identified six dams having the greatest overtopping probability, with several being located near large population centers, posing potential risks to the downstream communities. All six dams are classified as large and high-hazard potential. This study provides insights into dam management and risk assessment, emphasizing the need for proactive measures to mitigate potential threats.,Nature Communications
A bio-optical database for the remote sensing of water quality in BRAZil coAstal and inland waters (BRAZA),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05609-1,2025-07-21,Understanding water quality (WQ) is essential for grasping biogeochemical cycles and assessing human impacts such as deforestation, climate change, dam construction, illegal mining, and urbanization. However, monitoring WQ across Brazil’s vast aquatic systems requires significant resources. Remote sensing improves this process by offering high-resolution and large-scale observations. Nevertheless, to produce reliable remote-sensing WQ products based on remote sensing demands comprehensive datasets with concurrent aquatic reflectance and in situ measurements (e.g., Chlorophyll-a, Secchi Disk Depth, Suspended Sediments). Such data enables advanced semi-analytical and machine learning models to capture Brazil’s bio-optical water complexity. Collaborative efforts and open-data sharing are essential for building these datasets. Here, we introduce a new curated, high-quality bio-optical dataset across different aquatic systems in Brazil, called BRAZA (Bio-optical aquatic database for remote sensing of water quality in BRAZil coAstal and inland waters). By leveraging data from 17 institutions, covering 2,895 stations across + 128 lakes, rivers, reservoirs, and coastal areas of Brazil’s five administrative regions our dataset presents an important contribution to support remote sensing WQ-based analysis in Brazil.,Scientific Data

However, climate and land-use changes, particularly Amazon deforestation, have increased rainfall variability in the region in recent decades. Here, we investigate long-term growing-season rainfall changes over two major soybean breadbaskets in Brazil from the perspective of atmospheric moisture transport. Utilising a novel moisture tracking framework based on a Lagrangian model guided by observations, we identify moisture source regions where evaporation contributed to rainfall over these breadbaskets. Furthermore, we quantify the relative contributions of source evaporation versus atmospheric (thermo)dynamics changes to downwind rainfall variability. Our results indicate that deforestation-induced evaporation declines have negatively impacted downwind rainfall in the breadbasket regions. However, strengthened circulation, evidenced by increased water vapour transport and low-level wind speeds consistent with decreased tree cover, has enhanced moisture transport from upwind regions (including Amazonia and the Atlantic Ocean) to the Brazilian soybean breadbaskets. This highlights the compensatory effects of deforestation on rainfall through decreased evaporation and altered atmospheric (thermo)dynamics, and how these effects may influence downwind soybean productivity in South America. Further understanding these interactions is critical for developing land management strategies to mitigate the agricultural impacts of climate change in the region.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Episodic flooding causes sudden deoxygenation shocks in human-dominated rivers,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62236-5,2025-07-25,Dissolved oxygen (DO) sustains river ecosystems, but the effects of hydrological extremes remain poorly understood. While high river discharge (Q) enhances aeration, floods also deliver oxygen-consuming pollutants, making net impacts uncertain. Here, we analyze daily DO and its percent saturation (DO<sub>%sat</sub>), and Q in 1156 Chinese rivers over three years. We show that DO and DO<sub>%sat</sub> decrease with rising Q in 69.1% and 55.7% of rivers, respectively. Floods (Q &gt; 95<sup>th</sup> percentile) cause abrupt declines in both DO (19.7%) and DO<sub>%sat</sub> (16.2%) in 80.1% and 69.4% of the rivers, respectively, with the sharpest declines in agricultural and urban areas. These abrupt deoxygenation events link to increased ammonium and land-use intensity, causing more frequent hypoxia in developed regions. Contrary to initial expectations, floods often reduce oxygen levels, with faster recovery in urbanized regions. As climate change intensifies flooding, such sudden deoxygenation shocks may degrade aquatic ecosystems particularly in human-altered landscapes.,Nature Communications
Dataset on wastewater quality monitoring with adsorption and reflectance spectrometry in the UV-vis range,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05459-x,2025-07-25,A major challenge in wastewater and sewer system monitoring is the development of advanced sensing technologies to improve standard pollutant measurement and allow real-time online detection of emerging contaminants. This study presents a dataset from a 25-week measurement campaign comparing a novel hyperspectral imaging system to state-of-the-art ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) sensors. The dataset includes 5801 hyperspectral images of raw wastewater, measurements of temperature, ammonium, flow, turbidity, pH, and UV-vis absorbance spectra, as well as 533 grab samples analyzed for conventional pollutants. We also gathered 86 samples after four rain events and analyzed them for twenty organic chemicals, providing insights into the impact of wet weather on pollutant levels. The data collection and processing methodologies are detailed, along with visualizations and analysis. Despite difficulties in the maintenance of some sensors, in particular the ion-selective electrode for ammonium measurement, the dataset’s high temporal resolution, the time span of 25 weeks, and the extensive range of analyzed pollutants make it a valuable resource for advancing the field of urban water management.,Scientific Data
Global South shows higher urban flood exposures than the Global North under current and future scenarios,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02585-7,2025-07-28,Urbanization has intensified in recent decades, raising concerns about increasing flood exposure in cities. Here, we assess urban flood exposure in terms of built-up area, population, and economic activity located within zones affected by 1-in-100-year river flood events. We use global historical data from 2000 to 2020 and future projections from 2030 to 2100 under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. From 2000 to 2020, global urban flood exposure increased substantially, with the most severe impacts in East Asia and the fastest growth in Africa. Future exposure continues to rise, especially under high-risk development scenarios. From 2030 to 2100, flood-exposed urban area, population, and economy in Global South are more than twice, nearly five times, and over twice those in Global North, respectively. Inequality in exposure is greater within developing regions than developed ones. These disparities are projected to widen, highlighting the urgent need for targeted, region-specific strategies to reduce flood risks.,Communications Earth & Environment
CAMELSH: A Large-Sample Hourly Hydrometeorological Dataset and Attributes at Watershed-Scale for CONUS,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05612-6,2025-07-28,We present CAMELSH (Catchment Attributes and Hourly HydroMeteorology for Large-Sample Studies), the first large-sample hydrometeorological dataset at the hourly scale for the contiguous United States. CAMELSH intergrates hourly meteorological time series, catchment attributes and boundaries from GAGES-II and HydroATLAS for 9,008 catchments across diverse climatic, hydrological, and anthropogenic conditions. In addition, hourly streamflow time series is provided for 3,166 catchments. The dataset spans 45 years (1980–2024) with 11 meteorological variables from the NLDAS-2 forcing dataset, from which we compute nine climate indices related to precipitation, evapotranspiration, seasonality, and snow fraction. Additionally, CAMELSH includes two sets of catchment attributes: 439 from GAGES-II and 195 derived from HydroATLAS. These attributes include factors related to climate, geology, hydrology, river/stream morphology, landscape, nutrient, soil, topography, and anthropogenic influences. Developed in accordance with FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles, CAMELSH is the first large-sample dataset at an hourly timescale, supporting machine learning applications for short-term streamflow (flood) prediction and advancing data-driven hydrological research across multiple timescales.,Scientific Data
Outburst of a subglacial flood from the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-025-01746-9,2025-07-30,As Earth’s climate warms, surface melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet has intensified, increasing rates of sea-level rise. Observations and theory indicate that meltwater generated at the ice sheet surface can drain to its bed, where it flows relatively unhindered to the ocean. This understanding of water movement within and beneath ice sheets underpins the theoretical models that are used to make projections of ice sheet change. Here we present evidence of a destructive mode of meltwater drainage in Greenland. Using multiple satellite sources, we show that a 90-million-cubic-metre subglacial flood forced its way upwards from the bed, fracturing the ice sheet, and bursting through the surface. This phenomenon was triggered by the rapid drainage of a subglacial lake and occurred in a region where the ice bed was predicted to be frozen. The resulting flood caused a rapid deceleration of the downstream marine-terminating glacier. Our observations reveal a complex, bi-directional coupling between the ice sheet’s surface and basal hydrological systems and demonstrate that extreme hydrological forcing may occur in regions of predicted cold-based ice. Such processes can impact the ice sheet’s dynamics and structural integrity but are not currently considered in ice sheet models.,Nature Geoscience
A non-optically active lake salinity dataset by satellite remote sensing,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05686-2,2025-07-30,Water salinity characterizes the physicochemical properties of natural water, serving as an essential parameter for assessing lake water quality. However, the efficiency of remote sensing inversion of water salinity is limited as salinity is a non-optically active parameter, leading to the lack of a pixel-scale lake salinity dataset. Conventional function models based on salinity tracers or single lakes have low regional applicability, while machine learning algorithms can effectively capture the nonlinear relationship between radiance and salinity, providing large-scale inversion opportunities. Our study constructed an extreme gradient boosting (XGB) salinity model, which was used to generate the Inner Mongolia lake salinity (IMSAL) dataset with Sentinel-2 remote sensing reflectance. The IMSAL dataset contains 928 raster scenes with 10-meter spatial resolution for eight lakes from 2016 to 2024. Cross-validation and independent validation with measured and published literature-recorded salinities confirmed the good consistency and reliability. This dataset provides invaluable information on spatial patterns and long-term variations in lake salinity useful to prevent lake salinization and facilitate the lake management for sustainable ecosystem development.,Scientific Data
Coastal aquifers key contributors to ocean chemistry through solute fluxes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62411-8,2025-08-01,Understanding the ocean’s chemical composition is key to assessing the carbon cycle and its climate impact, especially through its control on calcium carbonate saturation and preservation. While rivers and hydrothermal systems are recognized contributors to ocean chemistry, the role of coastal aquifers has been underestimated. This study shows that long-term submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is a major source of solute fluxes to the ocean, especially of calcium and alkalinity, while removing sodium and potassium. Through analysis of elemental and isotopic ocean budgets, we find that fluxes from long-term SGD rival those from rivers in magnitude. These fluxes influence the residence times of major elements and significantly affect the global carbon budget. Moreover, they are dynamically linked to sea-level changes: falling sea levels enhance SGD-driven solute inputs, whereas rising sea levels suppress them. These patterns suggest that SGD fluxes may regulate long-term climate trends, including rates of global cooling or warming.,Nature Communications
ECIRA - European crop-specific irrigated area at 1 km resolution annually from 2010 to 2020,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05628-y,2025-08-04,Irrigation significantly contributes to total water withdrawal and exhibits considerable spatial and temporal variability, particularly in more humid regions. This variability is caused by climate, soil properties, and crop water requirements. However, time series of high-resolution, crop-specific irrigated area data remain scarce in Europe. We developed and applied a method to harmonize input data on crop types and irrigation to obtain the European Crop-specific IRrigated Area (ECIRA) dataset, providing annual 1-km gridded crop-specific irrigated area for 16 crop types across 28 European countries for 2010–2020. The ECIRA dataset effectively identifies crop-specific irrigated hotspots, aligns with subnational census data, and strongly agrees with LUCAS field observations and other survey-based crop-specific irrigation area datasets. However, caution is needed for region- and location-specific studies, as the Europe-wide scope of ECIRA entails a trade-off between local details and overall consistency. It can be used in assessments of crop productivity and crop water use, as input in land surface-, crop-, and hydrological modeling, in climate impact studies and to support improved water resources management.,Scientific Data
A comprehensive water bodies dataset of high-mountain Asia,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05659-5,2025-08-04,High-Mountain Asia (HMA) hosts numerous water bodies that are highly sensitive to climate change. However, many of them, especially small ones, remain understudied due to the region’s complex terrain and extreme environmental conditions. In this study, we propose a multi-stage segmentation–classification framework that combines spectral–textural feature extraction with object-based refinement. This method demonstrates enhanced capabilities for detecting water bodies as small as 0.001 km<sup>2</sup>, even under complex imaging conditions. Validation shows a unit-level misclassification rate of 0.1% and an 88% reduction in false positives, particularly from shadows and non-water patches, compared to existing satellite-derived datasets. Consequently, we generated a comprehensive inventory of 451,777 water bodies across the HMA, more than doubling previous records. The dataset includes morphological and hydrological attributes (e.g., area, perimeter, connectivity), with 83,246 water bodies in glacial regions (2–6 times more than previous estimates) and 274,039 in permafrost regions, 16.6% of which are newly identified small water bodies (&lt;3 km<sup>2</sup>). These results provide a critical resource for understanding water dynamics in this climatically vulnerable region.,Scientific Data
A global humidity index with lateral hydrologic flows,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09359-3,2025-08-06,The aridity index is widely used to indicate water availability on land. Balancing climatic water supply (precipitation, P) against demand (potential evapotranspiration, PET), it is often expressed as the P/PET ratio<sup>1</sup> or humidity index. Water also flows laterally by rivers and groundwater, from hills to valleys and from mountains to plains, subsidizing the receiving lowlands<sup>2</sup>. Here, we show that this lateral subsidy reduces aridity in the receiving lowlands. We first estimate monthly subsidies (Qlat) by surface and groundwater at 30″ global grids with a global hydrology model. We then calculate the conventional global humidity index (GHI) as P/PET and a new GHI including Qlat as (P + Qlat)/PET. Termed GHI_topo, the latter reflects land topography, higher in hydrologically convergent lowlands. It also exhibits a delayed and dampened seasonality (relative to P) owing to delayed and diffused Qlat arrival at the receiving lowlands. Such spatiotemporal features of Qlat, arising from both the climate and the terrain, make GHI_topo a more realistic indicator of local water availability in downgradient societies and ecosystems, enabling life in arid locations and times. Global land area with GHI_topo ≥ 1 (supply meets or exceeds demand) is 33% greater than GHI ≥ 1 and far higher in arid and season-arid climates.,Nature
Deglaciation drove seawater infiltration and slowed submarine groundwater discharge,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-025-01750-z,2025-08-06,Submarine groundwater discharge—the flow of groundwater into the ocean—plays an important role in shaping coastal biogeochemical cycles. The absence of temporal constraints on offshore groundwater dynamics driven by proximal glacial loading hinders our assessment of how its circulation may vary in conceivable ice-free polar regions. Here we estimate residence times of saline groundwater at an active submarine groundwater discharge and methane seep site off the coast of northern Norway, near the continental shelf break. The subsurface hydrology in this area experienced drastic changes due to Fennoscandian Ice Sheet dynamics, offering insights into the consequences of glacial–interglacial transitions for offshore groundwater. Using radiocarbon dating of dissolved inorganic carbon in the upwards-advected groundwater, we determined saline groundwater residence times of 11.5 to 8.8 kyr and 4.8 to 2.6 kyr at two distinct discharge sites. The presence of a meteoric water component in sediment porewaters confirms offshore groundwater freshening driven by past glacial loading. This indicates that, as the ice sheet retreated and sea levels rose, seawater began to infiltrate the subsurface, replacing freshwater recharge. Our results provide observational evidence pinpointing the onset of seawater infiltration following deglaciation of the margin. These findings suggest that retreating marine-terminating glaciers will profoundly alter offshore groundwater composition and reduce discharge rates.,Nature Geoscience
Unprecedented large-scale aquifer recovery through human intervention,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62719-5,2025-08-07,Groundwater depletion is a critical global challenge, particularly in intensively cultivated drylands, with few documented cases of successful recovery. Here, we report a striking reversal of long-term groundwater decline in the North China Plain, one of the world’s most severely depleted aquifers. Based on a comprehensive analysis of groundwater levels from over 2000 monitoring wells spanning the past two decades, we show that groundwater levels have risen at an average rate of ~0.7 m year<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> since 2020, surpassing 2005 levels by 2024. This recovery is driven by a combination of large-scale surface water diversion from the humid south and stringent groundwater pumping regulations, further amplified by wet years (e.g., 2021). From 2005 to 2023, these policies reduced annual groundwater abstraction by ~12 km<sup>3</sup> and increased environmental water allocations to over 7 km<sup>3</sup> since 2021, promoting aquifer recharge and restoring environmental flows. Our findings demonstrate that rapid, large-scale groundwater recovery is achievable through integrated water management and targeted policy interventions across extensive regions (~130,000 km<sup>2</sup>).,Nature Communications
High-resolution estimates of the US population in fluvial or coastal flood hazard areas,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05717-y,2025-08-07,Flooding is the most common and damaging natural disaster in the United States (US), and understanding the number of people at risk of flooding is critical information for planning. The dataset presented here uses publicly available census and building footprint data to improve upon previous estimates of the number of people and housing units in fluvial or coastal flood hazard areas in the contiguous US. To calculate the population and housing unit estimates, the ratio of total residential building footprint area that intersects high flood hazard areas is multiplied by 2020 Decennial Census block counts. This flexible framework will allow the dataset to be updated over time and with additional flood risk datasets such as those that incorporate pluvial flooding. These high-resolution estimates of people and housing in fluvial or coastal flood hazard areas will provide valuable information to flood resilience planning efforts.,Scientific Data
Quantitative subsurface characterization illuminates the origin of the Quaternary Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02545-1,2025-08-08,The Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer (MRVA) is vital to U.S. food security and global agricultural supply. However, quantitative understanding of its Quaternary origin, architecture, and hydrologic function remains incomplete. Here we develop a three-dimensional hydrostratigraphic model to characterize the deposition of clay and silt, fine-medium sands, and graveliferous sands using lithologic data from 75,000 boreholes compiled across the Lower Mississippi Valley and a geostatistical method—interval kriging. We find that cyclic glacial entrenchments, evidenced by remnants of pre-Wisconsinan postglacial sediments, alongside geodynamic activities shaped the MRVA basal configuration. Stratal weakening from faulting and salt diapirism enhanced glacial incision and thereby produced abrupt aquifer thickening. We demarcate the top of graveliferous sands as the regional marker of the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. The MRVA hydrostratigraphy reveals hydrologic function and geologic controls on groundwater storage and quality, advancing the assessment of aquifer sustainability under a changing climate, with implications for alluvial aquifers globally.,Communications Earth & Environment
Factors influencing surface water accumulation in beaver pond complexes across the Western United States,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02573-x,2025-08-11,North American beavers (Castor canadensis) build dams and ponds that alter streamflow, enhance floodplain water storage, and provide refugia during droughts and wildfires. However, drivers of pond area variability remain poorly understood. Here, we quantified the influencing factors that drive pond area and dam length variations using an explanatory modeling approach, after mapping surface water area of beaver ponds and creating beaver pond complexes. Mapped area correlated well with manual delineations (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.89), and additive pond area and dam length across 87 complexes followed a significant log-log scaling relationship. Dam length was the strongest covariate of pond area, while woody vegetation height and stream power index were also influential; together, these covariates explained 74% of the variation. Our results provide an empirical foundation to inform site selection and prioritization for beaver restoration, supporting watershed management, climate resilience and ecological conservation strategies in regions with comparable data availability and landscape characteristics.,Communications Earth & Environment
Skillful subseasonal soil moisture drought forecasts with deep learning-dynamic models,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62761-3,2025-08-12,Deep neural networks that learn from climate reanalysis data have produced skillful weather forecasts within ten days. However, it is still a great challenge for dynamic models to predict soil moisture, droughts, and other extreme events with lead times beyond two weeks. Here, we combine a recursive deep learning model (namely RISE-UNet) and subseasonal forecasts from dynamic models and achieve skillful forecasts of root zone soil moisture up to four weeks in advance. Our hybrid model, combining RISE-UNet and dynamic model forecasts, outperforms reanalysis-driven RISE-UNet models, while both methods show significantly higher performance than the latest European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) dynamic models, the postprocessed ECMWF or GEFS subseasonal forecasts by RISE-UNet, or ensemble model output statistics. The hybrid model shows skill in predicting flash droughts, which is higher than ECMWF and GEFS models in most cases, as demonstrated for major events in the United States, China, and Australia. The forecast skill of the hybrid modeling approach from weeks three to four is mainly due to the inclusion of the first two-week dynamic model forecasts and antecedent root zone soil moisture reanalysis. Our results indicate that combining deep learning with dynamic model forecasts can substantially improve the skill of subseasonal predictions beyond two weeks, particularly for root zone soil moisture and flash drought events.,Nature Communications
Domestic wastewater is an overlooked source and quantity in global river dissolved carbon,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62920-6,2025-08-13,Riverine dissolved carbon (DC) plays a crucial role in global carbon cycle. Yet, the contribution of wastewater to global riverine DC remains unquantified. Here, we quantify the impact of treated and untreated domestic wastewater on dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) loadings at nation and river basin scales. We show that, globally, domestic wastewater discharges ~21.4 Tg DC annually—6.42 Tg DIC and 1.17 Tg DOC from treated, and 9.64 Tg DIC and 4.21 Tg DOC from untreated, collectively accounting for 3.13 ± 0.46% of the global riverine DC export. Contributions are highest in densely populated regions with high treatment capacity. Effluent DC levels are influenced by treatment technology, temperature, precipitation, economic growth and urban development. This underscores a need to incorporate the wastewater derived carbon into global carbon budget assessment, as well as to monitor and reduce carbon in wastewater effluents.,Nature Communications
Episodic reservoir flooding transforming sediment sinks to sources and the potential global implications,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02666-7,2025-08-13,Reservoirs are widely recognized as sediment sinks, but the role of silted-up reservoirs as sediment sources remains poorly understood. This study presents quantitative assessments on episodic erosion effects of reservoirs in the Yellow River. Here we showed that sediment erosion during the 2019 flooding was 112 and 265 million tons at the Sanmenxia and Xiaolangdi reservoirs, respectively. Nearly all the Sanmenxia erosion was attributable to natural floods, whereas only ~40% of the Xiaolangdi erosion resulted from natural floods with the rest from drawdown and artificial flooding. These erosions contributed ~1/4 of decadal fluvial sediment flux. Reservoir erosion increased downstream suspended sediment concentration by over two orders of magnitude. Threshold siltation ratios (sedimentation volume/storage capacity) for initial erosion in the studied reservoirs ranged from 28% to 87%, averaging 60% ± 21%. Considering many reservoirs experiencing &gt;30% capacity loss and intensifying floods under global warming, reservoir erosion will become more frequent worldwide.,Communications Earth & Environment
Amplified impacts of multi-year La Niñas on soil moisture compared to single-year La Niñas,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01175-w,2025-08-14,This study examines December-January-February (DJF) soil moisture responses to multi-year (MY) and single-year (SY) La Niñas using a 2200-year CESM1 simulation, AGCM experiments, and observational data. Four regions where MY La Niñas amplify SY La Niñas’ impacts on soil moisture were identified: North America, Australia, the Middle East, and the Sahel. SY La Niñas typically cause soil moisture drying in the Middle East and North America and wetting in Australia and the Sahel. MY La Niñas enhance these effects in the second DJF due to the strengthening of precipitation anomalies or the accumulation of precipitation-induced soil moisture anomalies, except in the Sahel where wetting is driven in part by evapotranspiration anomalies. Soil moisture variations are linked to La Niña-induced sea surface temperature changes in the Indian Ocean (for Australia and the Middle East) and the Pacific Ocean (for North America). These amplified effects are largely supported by the observed MY La Niña events from 1948 to 2022. These findings emphasize the need to integrate MY La Niñas into regional agriculture and water resource management strategies to better anticipate and mitigate their impacts.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Historical dataset of reservoir construction in arid regions,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05712-3,2025-08-14,Reservoirs are important for flood control, irrigation, and electricity generation, and the scarcity of water resources in arid areas makes the role of reservoirs even more important. We registered 669 reservoirs distributed in China’s arid zones and supplemented the reservoir-related historical and socio-economic data, and the reservoir information completion degree in the dataset reached 98.53%. The study showed that the construction of reservoirs in China’s arid zones can generally be divided into rapid growth, stable growth, and high-quality growth phases. According to the hydrological pattern of the arid zone, the spatial distribution of reservoirs in the arid zone overlaps strongly with the distribution of agricultural land and population, and the construction of reservoirs significantly affects socio-economic development. The historical and socio-economic dataset of reservoir construction in China’s arid zones provides a scientific basis for solving the problems of reservoir construction and abandonment, reservoir optimality and scheduling, efficient use of regional water resources, ecological construction, and sustainable development.,Scientific Data
Snow monitoring at strategic locations improves water supply forecasting more than basin-wide mapping,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02660-z,2025-08-15,In the Western United States, water supply forecasting has traditionally relied on snow water equivalent measurements at ground-based stations due to their strong correlations with streamflow volume during spring and summer. However, stations are sparse and sample a small area, prompting interest in spatially complete – but costly – basin-wide mapping from airborne surveys or future satellite missions. Here we show that adding strategic measurements at snow hotspots – localized areas with untapped information for predicting streamflow – consistently outperforms spatially complete surveys that provide basin-average snowpack, both in basins with and without existing stations. While both improve forecast skill, hotspot monitoring increases correlations with streamflow volume by 11-14% (median) across 390 basins, compared to 4% from basin-wide surveys. These findings hold across snowpack datasets, skill metrics, and statistical models. The greatest gains in water supply prediction come from leveraging existing stations and expanding snow measurements to the right places, rather than everywhere.,Communications Earth & Environment
PDSI_CMIP6: an ensemble CMIP6-projected self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index dataset,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05790-3,2025-08-16,Drought, characterized by below-average water supply, profoundly affects regional water resources and various ecosystem services. The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) is a widely used metric for drought monitoring and climate change assessments but suffers from inherent climatic inconsistencies and lacks comprehensive and reliable estimates under changing climate conditions. Here we develop a monthly multi-model and multi-scenario dataset of self-calibrated PDSI for the period 1850–2094, derived from 11 climate model outputs within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (PDSI_CMIP6). The traditional two-layer bucket model in PDSI is replaced with direct hydrological outputs from CMIP6 models, ensuring alignment with CMIP6 projections. The PDSI estimates are validated against soil moisture simulations through correlation and regression analysis. Application of the dataset reveals pronounced spatial heterogeneity in long-term drought trends across continents, with limited global-mean change but notable regional intensification under climate change. This dataset provides uncertainty-constrained quantifications of terrestrial moisture conditions in a changing climate, faithfully reflecting CMIP6-projected hydrological changes.,Scientific Data
Regional-scale intelligent optimization and topography impact in restoring global precipitation data gaps,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02624-3,2025-08-18,Ground rainfall observations are essential for improving gauge-adjusted satellite precipitation estimates, particularly in the Global Precipitation Measurement mission era. However, over 60% of countries lack a complete surface-based rainfall gauge network, severely constraining the accuracy of global satellite precipitation retrievals. Here we present a model that integrates regional-scale intelligent optimization, topographic analysis, and an end-to-end neural network to merge multi-source precipitation data and reconstruct global spatiotemporal precipitation fields with resolved data gaps across scales. Our evaluation demonstrates that the model substantially improves satellite precipitation accuracy, increasing the correlation coefficient from 0.66 to 0.77. In particular, satellite estimates at high rain rates and over complex terrains show marked improvement when the model is applied. These findings suggest that the proposed approach holds strong potential for future applications in storm monitoring and flood forecasting, especially in mountainous regions with sparse observational data.,Communications Earth & Environment
The important role of wetland conservation and restoration in nitrogen removal across European river basins,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-025-00465-0,2025-08-19,In Europe, excessive inputs of nitrogen threaten ecosystems and public health. Wetlands act as natural filters, removing excess nutrients and protecting downstream waters. Using high-resolution data on nitrogen surplus and wetland distribution, we estimate that existing European wetlands remove 1,092 ± 95 kt of nitrogen per year. Restoring 27% of wetlands historically drained for agriculture (3% of land area), targeted in high nitrogen input areas, could reduce current nitrogen loads to the sea by 36%, but with potential costs to agricultural productivity. A more efficient strategy targets wetland restoration on farmlands projected to be abandoned by 2040, yielding a 22% load reduction and enabling major rivers such as the Rhine, Elbe and Vistula to meet water quality targets with minimal agricultural impact. Our findings highlight wetland restoration as a cost-effective, policy-relevant solution that, if spatially targeted, can deliver major water quality improvements while supporting the European Union’s broader goals on climate, biodiversity and agricultural sustainability.,Nature Water
A climatological baseline for understanding patterns of seasonal lake dynamics across sub-Sahelian Africa,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02684-5,2025-08-20,Lakes in sub-Sahelian Africa are facing growing ecological threats from climate change and human, yet most research has focused on a handful of well-known large lakes. This study analyses 137 lakes, many previously understudied, and identifies consistent seasonal co-variability patterns across meteorological variables, satellite-derived lake physical and biogeochemical variables, and morphological and anthropogenic characteristics. We identify four distinct clusters of lakes, shaped by the atmospheric variability and its synchrony with water temperature seasonality. Within each cluster, we observe three seasonal patterns of chlorophyll-a concentration tied to wet and dry seasons. These patterns align with regional climatic threats in Africa, such as shifts in rainfall seasonality, altered frequency of tropical cyclones and wildfires, thus positioning our study as a framework to assess lake vulnerability across the sub-Sahelian region.,Communications Earth & Environment
Recombining past event precipitation and antecedent catchment states generates unprecedented floods,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02691-6,2025-08-22,River floods that exceed historical records often occur unexpectedly, causing widespread damage and disruption. To improve disaster preparedness, it is crucial to explore exceptional flood scenarios that surpass past observations. Here we introduce a perfect storm approach that recombines historically observed extremes in precipitation and soil moisture to generate plausible flood scenarios that are easy to understand by lay people and flood risk managers. Our analysis covers the ten most damaging floods recorded in Germany, two additional extreme precipitation events and two cases of exceptionally wet soil moisture conditions. The results show that the severity and damage of these recombined floods can systematically exceed those of the observed events, demonstrating the potential of the perfect storm approach to generate plausible scenarios of unprecedented floods. While shifting extreme rainfall to wetter soil consistently amplifies flood severity, moving events by just 1 month can also intensify flooding, which underscores the critical role of temporal alignment between catchment state and precipitation. Our study enables planners and policymakers to anticipate extreme flood scenarios beyond historical precedents, and offers a simple, yet powerful, strategy for obtaining flood scenarios to enhance disaster preparedness.,Communications Earth & Environment
30 Years of simultaneous crop & land cover land use maps for Middle Rio Grande from 1994 to 2024,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05771-6,2025-08-22,This study introduces the crop and land cover land use (CLCLU) dataset, a 30 m resolution product providing annual maps of CLCLU across the transnational Middle Rio Grande (MRG) region, spanning both the U.S. and Mexico from 1994 to 2024. The model was trained using the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) on the US side. Dual-month (July and December) Landsat composites and a semantic segmentation model, MANet with ResNeXt-101 encoder, under four strategies were used to address sensor and temporal variability. This model architecture was chosen for its intrinsic ability to capture detailed spatial patterns and contextual dependencies through its attention-based design and ResNeXt-101 encoder, which demonstrated strong performance, particularly in generalizing across data-scarce regions in Mexico. The dataset achieved 97.10% overall accuracy and 78.85% mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), over validation process using a held-out CDL subset. Validation against NLCD and MCD12Q1-UMD confirmed high agreement. Data availability differences, minimal ground truth on the Mexican side, and cloud-related artifacts in early years led to some misclassification.,Scientific Data
International reliance on Brazil’s water through soy and beef supply chains,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02658-7,2025-08-25,As commodities enter supply chains, consumers rely on distant freshwater sources to ensure continued supply. This information often lacks the traceability and granularity required to assess the reliance of supply chains on specific river basins and their level of water scarcity. Here, we quantify the volume and source of freshwater for the production and export of Brazilian soy and beef to China and the EU, together with deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions for the 2015–2017 period. Both sectors mainly rely on rainfed systems, but also soy irrigation and a combination of cattle drinking and evaporation from reservoirs serving as the drinking source. About 20% and 50% of the freshwater required for exports to China and the EU, respectively, rely on river basins with high or critical water scarcity. Our study further shows how a multi-indicator assessment is key to guiding decisions in commodity sectors towards sustainable production and supply chains.,Communications Earth & Environment
Global response of floods to tropical explosive volcanic eruptions,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-025-01782-5,2025-08-26,Tropical volcanic eruptions with a high volcanic explosivity index (≥5) impact the global climate system, but little is known about how they affect floods. Here, leveraging global climate model simulations with volcanic forcings and statistical relationships between seasonal climate drivers and peak discharge, we investigate the response of seasonal peak discharges at 7,886 streamgauges worldwide to three tropical explosive volcanic eruptions in the twentieth century: Agung 1963 (Indonesia), Santa Maria 1902 (Guatemala) and Pinatubo 1991 (Philippines), whose stratospheric aerosol plumes were distributed primarily in the Southern Hemisphere, primarily in the Northern Hemisphere and symmetrically across both hemispheres, respectively. For the eruptions with interhemispherically asymmetric aerosol distributions, tropical regions show more immediate and widespread responses to the eruptions than non-tropical regions, with a distinct interhemispheric contrast of decreasing (increasing) peak discharges in the hemisphere in which the eruption happened (did not happen). For the case of symmetric aerosol distribution, tropical (arid) regions have the strongest tendency to respond to the eruption by decreasing (increasing) peak discharges in both hemispheres. These regional flood responses are attributed mainly to seasonal precipitation changes across the climate regions. Beyond direct volcanic hazards, our study provides a global view of the secondary flood hazards resulting from hydroclimatic changes induced by large explosive eruptions.,Nature Geoscience
Observed streamflow data shows El Niño–Southern Oscillation increases likelihood of extreme events in South America,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02714-2,2025-08-26,Understanding how the El Niño–Southern Oscillation influences extreme streamflow events is essential for anticipating water-related risks in South America. Here, we analyse the relationship between this climate phenomenon and the likelihood of floods and droughts using a multi-decadal observational dataset of river discharge. We quantify how the probabilities of extreme events shift under different phases of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation. The results show that flood likelihood increases by over 120% during El Niño in the La Plata Basin and by over 120% during La Niña in the northern Amazon. Maximum precipitation and streamflow signals are generally aligned, but flood flows exhibit stronger amplification than high precipitation, suggesting a cumulative climate effect on extreme events. In contrast, increased drought probabilities of more than 120% is linked to El Niño in the Amazon, while La Niña raises drought risk in inland South America of more than 80%.,Communications Earth & Environment
Hysteresis of submarine karst springs reveals tipping points in flow reversal and saline intrusion phenomena,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02522-8,2025-08-26,Submarine springs that drain inland karst aquifers may be subject to abrupt flow reversals in which alternatively freshwater outflows to the sea or saltwater inflows into the aquifer. Here we provide a full flow reversal long-duration data time series at the Vise spring (below Thau lagoon, south of France) during which saltwater inflows into the aquifer. We demonstrate that the driving parameter of the hydrosystem regime shifts is the hydraulic gradient between the aquifer and the lagoon, controlled by water density changes. We reveal the existence of two tipping points: (i) below a hydraulic gradient threshold, the hydrosystem suddenly degrades from a normal regime to saltwater intrusion, and (ii) a much larger hydraulic gradient is necessary for the recovery of the hydrosystem. The high hysteresis of the hydrosystem, due to the vertical karst conduit filling by saltwater, is responsible for the long duration of the degradation and saltwater intrusion. In a changing climate context, flow reversal at submarine karst springs could be more frequent and longer in the future due to sea level rise and a decrease in recharge, threatening inland or offshore freshwater resources.,Communications Earth & Environment
Experiments on flow over obstacle arrays: a database for turbulent flow and wave transformation modeling,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05783-2,2025-08-29,This data descriptor presents a detailed dataset of open-channel flow interacting with arrays of obstacles, originating from a laboratory experimental campaign involving Gaussian- and log-normal-shaped obstacles arranged sequentially in a flume, as well as a solitary dune profile. Six different array configurations were tested. Both steady and unsteady flow conditions were implemented resulting in a wide range of experiments. Data on free surface flow level, flume bed level, and head pressure data were systematically extracted using a methodology specifically designed for this purpose. The dataset is supplemented with schematic representations of the data and panoramas images of the experiments, including characteristics of turbulence and wave transformation phenomena. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first database in the literature to comprehensively examine the interaction of flow with various obstacle arrays under both steady and unsteady flow conditions. Combined with the detailed description of the employed methodology, this data descriptor is expected to promote significant usage of the dataset, benefiting the open-channel flow modeling community.,Scientific Data
Flood inundation amplified by large-scale ground subsidence funnel under the ongoing global climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02669-4,2025-08-29,Global climate change is leading to more severe rainfalls, greatly exacerbating the inundation risk of large-scale subsidence funnels worldwide. Here, we present a case of flood disaster in a large ground subsidence funnel at the Liaohe plain of China in 2022, triggered by continuous heavy rainfall under the ongoing global climate change. We conducted a retrospective investigation and analysis of the disaster event and its impacts through the comprehensive utilization of satellite remote sensing, numerical simulation, and risk assessment techniques. We observed the scale of the subsidence funnel for nearly 50 years, quantitatively analyzed the impact of subsidence on the flood disaster, and assessed the flood disaster risk. The results indicated that the ground subsidence has partially compromised the flood protection capacity of rivers, elevating flood risk in this region by 28.24%. Additionally, the subsidence has also damaged the flood control dam, leading to a breach and a secondary flooding disaster. Our work demonstrates that it’s possible to characterize the inundation risk of large-scale subsidence funnels by spaceborne remote sensing in advance. This approach could enhance the capacity to cope with extreme weather events in similar ground subsidence regions worldwide.,Communications Earth & Environment
Diverging trends in large floods across Europe in a warming climate,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02734-y,2025-08-29,Large floods, which affect multiple regions simultaneously, pose substantial risks to lives and economies. In a warmer climate, increased precipitation extremes and reduced snowmelt are expected to alter flood characteristics, but how the dynamics of large floods across Europe will evolve under climate change remains unclear. By jointly assessing projected changes in the timing, spatial extent and volume of large floods in a warmer world, here we show that earlier snowmelt generally leads to earlier floods, while increasing precipitation contributions attenuate flood seasonality. Although continental-scale averages suggest limited change, they mask substantial regional heterogeneity. In western Europe, projected increases in heavy precipitation result in larger flood extents and volumes. In contrast, reduced snowmelt dominates changes in the largest floods in northern Europe, with localized shifts from snowmelt-driven to rainfall-driven floods. These regionally diverse responses of large floods to climate change should be considered in transnational flood risk management across Europe.,Communications Earth & Environment
Unprecedented UK heatwave harmonised drivers of fuel moisture creating extreme temperate wildfire risk,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02746-8,2025-09-01,Climate change is resulting in more extreme fire weather during major heatwaves. Across temperate Europe, shrub landscapes dominate the area burned, with the moisture content of fuels during these events determining the threat posed. Current controls on the moisture content of temperate fuel constituents and their response to future extreme heatwaves are not known. We took field measurements of live and dead heather (Calluna vulgaris) and organic soil moisture content across the UK over 3 years, including an intensive sampling campaign during the July 2022 heatwave. Here, we show that the fuel moisture content of live fuel is associated significantly with phenological variables, dead fuel only with weather variables, whilst organic-rich ground fuels are more associated with landscape variables. However, during the record 2022 heatwave there was a harmonisation in fuel moisture controls across different fuel constituents, with those controls being driven by weather alone. This caused synchronised extreme dryness outside of current seasonal norms across all fuel constituents at the same time and place. Future intense summer heatwaves can therefore be expected to align the most severe conditions for fire ignition, spread and impact in traditionally non-fire prone regions, producing humid temperate landscapes susceptible to extreme wildfire events.,Communications Earth & Environment
Transboundary conflict from surface water scarcity under climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63568-y,2025-09-01,Transboundary river basins (TRBs) are at risk of water scarcity-induced conflicts, especially given the rising water demand and impacts of climate change. Despite extensive efforts and some progress, the mechanisms linking water scarcity to conflicts in TRBs remain insufficiently understood, and identifying effective mitigation and adaptation strategies remains a challenge. In this study, we introduce a framework for predicting TRBs vulnerable to water scarcity-induced conflicts, based on the concept of water dependency, defined by monthly water scarcity. This framework successfully explains over 80% of the TRBs experiencing water scarcity-induced conflicts during 2005–2014. Our projections indicate that, without mitigation and adaptation measures, nearly 40% of global TRBs could face potential conflicts driven by water scarcity in 2041–2050, with hotspots in Africa, southern and central Asia, the Middle East, and North America. However, proactive measures such as intra-basin cooperation could reduce this proportion to less than 10%. This study underscores the urgency of increased investment and active stakeholder engagement to foster intra-basin cooperation and avert potential conflicts.,Nature Communications
Snowfall decrease in recent years undermines glacier health and meltwater resources in the Northwestern Pamirs,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02611-8,2025-09-02,Central Asia hosts some of the world’s last relatively healthy mountain glaciers and is heavily dependent on snow and ice melt for downstream water supply, though the causes of this stable glacier state are not known. We combine recent in-situ observations, climate reanalysis and remote sensing data to force a land-surface model to reconstruct glacier changes over the last two decades (1999–2023) and disentangle their causes over a benchmark glacierized catchment in Tajikistan. We show that snowfall and snow depth have been substantially lower since 2018, leading to a decline in glacier health and reduced runoff generation. Remote-sensing observations confirm wider snow depletion across the Northwestern Pamirs, suggesting that a lack of snowfall might be a cause of mass losses regionally. Our results provide an explanation for the recent decline in glacier health in the region, and reinforce the need to better understand the variability of precipitation.,Communications Earth & Environment
Divergent impacts of climate interventions on China’s north-south water divide,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02708-0,2025-09-04,Solar radiation modification-based climate interventions may cause uneven regional hydrological changes while mitigating warming. Here, we investigate the effects of climate interventions on China’s North Drought-South Flood pattern using the Norwegian Earth System Model supplemented by volcanic data. Our results indicate that equatorial stratospheric aerosol injection could mitigate the north-south water divide by reducing inter-hemispheric and equator-to-North-pole temperature gradients, thereby modifying atmospheric circulation and the East Asian monsoon to increase precipitation and surface runoff in northern China while reducing them in the south, compared to the high emissions scenario. This mechanism is supported by observed precipitation changes following the Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption. In contrast, marine cloud brightening may intensify southern flood risks, while cirrus cloud thinning and moderate emissions reduction might exacerbate northern droughts. Our findings reveal distinct regional hydroclimatic impacts of different climate interventions, highlighting potential synergies and trade-offs between their global intervention efficacy and regional water security.,Communications Earth & Environment
Hysteresis and reversibility of agroecological droughts in response to carbon dioxide removal,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-025-00487-8,2025-09-10,Agroecological droughts are expected to increase with climate change, becoming one of the greatest threats to ecosystems and human society. To mitigate climate change and the growing risk of agroecological droughts, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is increasingly recognized as unavoidable. However, it remains unclear whether the increase of agroecological drought due to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will be symmetrically reversed by an equivalent atmospheric CDR. Here we investigate this question by utilizing an idealized atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> emission and removal experiment from the CDR Model Intercomparison Project, involving eight Earth system models, and develop a new methodology to quantify climate hysteresis and reversibility. We find that drought increases in hotspot regions cannot be symmetrically reversed by an equivalent CDR: drought severity under the CDR pathway is 65% ± 30% greater than under the emission pathway; drought frequency increases are only partially reversed by 73% ± 18% when CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are balanced by equivalent CDR. Drought hysteresis and irreversibility are most pronounced in the Mediterranean, northern Central America, west and east southern Africa and southern Australia. Our findings imply irreversible drought impacts associated with CDR, highlighting the need for planning long-term drought adaptations.,Nature Water
Neglecting land–atmosphere feedbacks overestimates climate-driven increases in evapotranspiration,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-025-02428-5,2025-09-11,Accurate projections of evapotranspiration (ET) are crucial for understanding hydrological responses to climate warming, which remain highly uncertain because of complex land–atmosphere interactions. Here we develop a theoretical framework to disentangle these interactions, achieving highly consistent ET projections between offline and coupled models. Our findings show that previous estimates of climate-driven ET increases have been exaggerated, primarily due to a substantial overestimation of atmospheric evaporative demand. Notably, the atmospheric conditions often assumed to drive ET are, in fact, responses to ET changes induced by soil moisture and vegetation dynamics. Neglecting these land–atmosphere feedbacks has led to a 25–39% overestimation of climate-driven global ET increases and a 77–121% exaggeration of the negative contribution from land surface changes. These biases have caused large discrepancies in hydrological projections and attributions between offline and coupled models, underscoring the importance of accurately representing land–atmosphere interactions to improve the reliability and consistency of future hydrological projections.,Nature Climate Change
Greenland ice sheet runoff reduced by meltwater refreezing in bare ice,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62281-0,2025-09-12,The contribution of Greenland Ice Sheet meltwater runoff to global sea-level rise is accelerating due to increased melting of its bare-ice ablation zone. There is growing evidence, however, that climate models overestimate runoff from this critical area of the ice sheet. Climate models traditionally assume that all bare-ice runoff enters the ocean, unlike porous firn, in which some meltwater is retained and/or refrozen. We used field measurements and numerical modeling to reveal that extensive retention and refreezing also occurs in bare glacier ice. We found that, from 2009 to 2018, meltwater refreezing in bare, porous glacier ice reduced runoff by an estimated 11–17 Gt a<sup>−1</sup> in southwest Greenland alone, equivalent to 9–15% of this sector’s annual meltwater runoff simulated by climate models. This mass retention explains evidence from prior studies of runoff overestimation on bare ice by current generation climate models and may represent an overlooked buffer on projected runoff increases. Inclusion of bare-ice retention and refreezing processes in climate models therefore has immediate potential to improve forecasts of ice sheet runoff and its contribution to sea-level rise.,Nature Communications
Meltwater ponding has an underestimated radiative effect on the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62503-5,2025-09-12,Ponding of meltwater on the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet has the potential to reduce ice sheet albedo and amplify mass loss. However, this process remains poorly constrained and is absent from models that project ice sheet mass balance. Here we demonstrate that meltwater ponding considerably increases the amount of energy available for melting the Greenland Ice Sheet. We first use satellite-derived products to show that meltwater ponding has a significant impact on spatial albedo patterns, particularly in the lower percolation zone. We then use drone imagery to demonstrate that, in the upper ablation zone, there are thousands of narrow streams and small pools (&lt;100 m²) that collectively account for &gt;50% of the total meltwater area. These small meltwater features are not resolved by surface water maps derived from medium-resolution satellite imagery, signifying that the radiative effect of meltwater ponding is three to four times stronger than predicted by satellite-based approaches. Our findings therefore place lower bounds on the radiative effect of meltwater ponding that could be used to advocate for the inclusion of this process into models that forecast Greenland Ice Sheet’s contribution to sea-level rise.,Nature Communications
Anthropogenic impacts on the Yellow River Basin,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-025-00718-2,2025-09-16,The Yellow River Basin supports a population of 200 million people and contains 15% of arable land in China. Water scarcity in the region is being exacerbated by climate change and human activities. In this Review, we discuss anthropogenic impacts on the hydrological cycle and sediment dynamics of the Yellow River since the 1950s. The Yellow River had one of the largest sediment loads in the world, peaking at 2.1 Gt yr<sup>−1</sup> in 1958. Such high sediment loads elevated flood risk; therefore, reservoirs, conservation and revegetation projects were implemented, reducing sediment transport by 90% since the 1980s. However, these efforts also impacted the hydrology of the Yellow River Basin, leading to an increase in evapotranspiration fluxes (1.79 mm yr<sup>−2</sup>, 1980–2020) and reduced runoff. In addition, human water use has increased by 15.8% since the 1980s. The resulting reductions in soil water storage and intensification of the vertical water cycle foreshadow potential resource crises and will potentially lead to irreversible ecosystem degradation. Predicting the outcomes of water management policies and engineering projects is essential but highly complex owing to feedback loops and interactions between human activities and hydrological changes. Addressing these challenges, which are also faced by other arid-region rivers, will require dynamic monitoring of water storage and improved understanding of human–hydrological interactions.,Nature Reviews Earth & Environment
Financial losses associated with US floods occur with frequent low-return-period precipitation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-025-00506-8,2025-09-19,Flooding in the USA leads to billions of dollars in financial losses annually, with projected increases due to escalating extreme precipitation, population growth and deteriorating flood infrastructure. Federal regulation mandates flood insurance purchase within 100-year coastal and fluvial floodplains. Yet our analysis of millions of federal insurance claims reveals that most flood losses are associated with frequent, low-intensity precipitation events relative to regional climatology, with average regional precipitation return periods of under 5 years. Likewise, precipitation linked to disaster aid and property buyouts has return periods averaging less than 20 years. Using unsupervised learning, we identify that space-time precipitation clusters associated with major storms dominate losses, emphasizing the need for flood risk assessments and mitigation strategies that account for recurrent spatiotemporal compound events. The findings underscore the importance of flood risk management that extends beyond solely coastal and fluvial impacts into pluvial flood preparedness and assessment.,Nature Water
Progress and future directions in constraining uncertainties in sea-level projections using observations,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-025-02437-4,2025-09-19,Coastal planning, mitigation and adaptation efforts rely on credible sea-level projections generated by physical models. However, the large uncertainties in these projections pose a challenge for policymakers. Here we provide an overview of the main sources of uncertainty in model projections of sea-level change on multi-decadal to centennial timescales and we offer perspectives on the use of observations to narrow uncertainties. We propose several directions for future research, including improvements in emerging emulation techniques, more systematic quantification of uncertainty structure within both observations and models, lengthening observational records of processes, and expanding collaborations across physical and social sciences. Advancements in these areas are urgently needed, as the next phase of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment cycle gets underway.,Nature Climate Change
Satellite radar altimetry reveals spatial and temporal changes in water surface smoothness in the Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02715-1,2025-09-19,The Salar de Uyuni is a desert made of salt and is called the world’s largest natural mirror when it is covered with a thin layer of water. However, that statement has never been scientifically proven through research. The only evidence is from smartphone photographs taken along the border, as the interior area is not easily accessible during the wet season. Here, we present a methodology based on Radar Cross Section to measure surface smoothness using radar altimeter observations from Sentinel-3 satellites. The methodology was validated using ground-truth measurements collected during a unique field survey conducted in its interior while it was water-covered and coinciding with a satellite overpass. We show that the whole Salar de Uyuni is not a uniform mirror reflecting radar waves, as the smoothness at visible light wavelength would induce one to believe. Instead, the smoothness of the water surface evolves spatially and temporally.,Communications Earth & Environment
Detection of 85 new active subglacial lakes in Antarctica from a decade of CryoSat-2 data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63773-9,2025-09-19,Subglacial lake activity influences ice sheet flow, grounding line discharge and ice shelf basal melting. Although 146 active subglacial lakes have been detected in Antarctica via ice surface elevation change associated with their activity, only 36 fill-drain cycles have been observed worldwide, and knowledge of these mechanisms is limited. Here, we use a decade of CryoSat-2 radar altimetry to detect 85 active subglacial lakes in Antarctica, documenting 37 and 34 complete draining and filling events respectively. We delineate time-varying boundaries of subglacial lake activity and investigate their variability over time. Our observations increase the number of known active subglacial lakes in Antarctica by 58%, with six of these located within 8 km of the grounding zone. We observe five subglacial lake networks, with concurrent upstream drainage and downstream filling, and 25 clusters of lakes, improving our knowledge of interconnected subglacial hydrological pathways.,Nature Communications
The first emergence of unprecedented global water scarcity in the Anthropocene,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63784-6,2025-09-23,Access to water is crucial for all aspects of life. Anthropogenic global warming is projected to disrupt the hydrological cycle, leading to water scarcity. However, the timing and hotspot regions of unprecedented water scarcity are unknown. Here, we estimate the Time of First Emergence (ToFE) of drought-driven water scarcity events, referred to as “Day Zero Drought” (DZD), which arises from hydrological compound extremes, including prolonged rainfall deficits, reduced river flow, and increasing water consumption. Using a probabilistic framework and a large ensemble of climate simulations, we attribute the timing and likelihood of DZD events to human influence. Many regions, including major reservoirs, may face high risk of DZD by the 2020s and 2030s. Despite model and scenario uncertainties, consistent DZD hotspots emerge across the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and parts of North America. Urban populations are particularly vulnerable at the 1.5 °C warming level. The length of time between successive DZD events is shorter than the duration of DZD, limiting recovery periods and exacerbating water scarcity risks. Therefore, more proactive water strategies are urgently needed to avoid severe societal impacts of DZD.,Nature Communications
Effects of climate change on river and groundwater nutrient inputs to the coastal ocean,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02594-6,2025-09-24,Rivers and groundwater are major sources of nutrients to the global coastal ocean. Climate change is expected to impact nutrient fluxes from river basins and coastal aquifers through alterations to both hydrological and nutrient cycling processes. In this Review, we identify and summarize how climate change impacts, such as changes in precipitation, increased cryosphere melt, and sea level rise, will affect water discharge and nutrient concentrations in rivers and coastal groundwater, which ultimately control nutrient inputs to the coastal ocean. We also document key limitations in the current understanding of climate-related changes to nutrient fluxes, especially in coastal groundwater basins. The impacts of climate change will interact with local human impacts, highlighting the need for studies spanning local to global scales to better understand and improve predictions of future nutrient fluxes from these hydrological pathways.,Communications Earth & Environment
Drought constrictions on lateral carbon transport,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-025-01807-z,2025-09-26,Drought impedes the lateral flux of carbon along continental river networks to the oceans due to reduction in water flow. Here we show that, in addition to lower flow, drought also exacerbates secondary carbonate formation and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. We report sub-hourly field measurements of major ion chemistry in the upper Sangamon River in North America, revealing that drought accelerates the characteristically rapid pace of carbonate mineral formation at the watershed scale. Over 195 consecutive days of moderate hydrologic drought, we observe a 17% decrease in annual riverine lateral carbon flux due to secondary carbonate formation, in addition to the restrictions imposed by low flow rates, indicating a natural limit to the inorganic carbon carrying capacity of rivers. We use historical datasets and a compilation of global river geochemistry measurements to show that this phenomenon is reproducible and widespread during periods of drought.,Nature Geoscience
Strategizing renewable energy transitions to preserve sediment transport integrity,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-025-01626-5,2025-09-26,Hydropower is vital for climate mitigation by enabling low-carbon energy systems, but hydropower dams also trap sediment, a crucial resource for ecosystems and climate adaptation along downstream coastlines. Here we present a multisectoral integrated water–sediment–energy planning framework that fully internalizes the impacts of hydropower expansion, both on energy system costs and on foregone ecosystem services from reduced sediment supply for the Mekong River Basin. Our analysis indicates that full development of large hydropower could reduce sediment flows to the Mekong Delta by 41.2 ± 6.6 megatonnes per year (75 ± 9%). However, strategically replacing 19 high-sediment-trapping hydropower plants with solar, wind and energy storage alternatives could preserve up to 98% of sediment supply, with only a 4–6% (US$15.7–26.0 billion) increase in energy system costs over 2020–2050. Crucially, when sediment-related benefits—valued at US$12–28 million per megatonne per year—are considered, the additional costs of preserving sediment supply are nearly offset. The proposed framework offers a transferable approach to support sustainable low-carbon energy transitions while safeguarding sediment-dependent ecosystems worldwide.,Nature Sustainability
Direct human interventions drive spatial variability in long-term peak streamflow trends across the United States,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02738-8,2025-09-29,Understanding non-stationarity in annual peakflow is critical amid climate change and human interventions<sup>1,2</sup>. We analyzed trends in peakflow across 3907 streamflow sites with a median record length of 80 years in the continental United States. Results showed that one-third of the sites have significant trends. Of these, two-thirds showed decreasing trends nationwide, while one-third showed increasing trends in the Northeast and Great Lakes regions. We found urbanization and water management as primary drivers, with agriculture and climate as secondary. Urbanization explained up to 62% of the variance in Texas-Gulf, 44% in California, and 32% in the Mid-Atlantic regions. Water management dominated in Tennessee (37%) and Ohio (30%) regions. Agriculture was most influential in the Great Lakes (17%) region, while climate contributed in the Rio Grande (15%) and California (11%) regions. Although the latest climate model provides many realizations, it inadequately captures direct human interventions in the water system.,Communications Earth & Environment
National soil hydrologic groups map for environmental applications using data-driven and expert-based methods,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05853-5,2025-09-29,Regional and national 3D soil hydraulic maps enhance understanding of soil hydraulic properties, essential for environmental assessments. However, data aggregation is often necessary in large-scale models to facilitate the modelling of complex soil characteristics. This study presents a soil hydrologic groups map for Hungary, derived through k-means clustering and expert-based rules. Clustering was applied to the 100 m resolution 3D HU-SoilHydroGrids database, considering eight hydraulic parameters across six depths. The accuracy of these maps is limited for rare soil types with extreme characteristics due to their small spatial extent and sparse representation in national datasets. To account for these underrepresented soil types, we refined each statistics-based cluster using expert-based rules incorporating soil profile depth, genetic type, electrical conductivity, and exchangeable sodium content. The final classification includes 68 soil hydrologic groups, defined by distinct hydraulic properties, such as van Genuchten parameters to describe water retention, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. This national map supports country-wide hydrological modelling, environmental management, and agricultural planning in Hungary by enabling consistent treatment of similar soils.,Scientific Data
A groundwater well database for Brazil (GWDBrazil),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05843-7,2025-09-29,Sufficient spatiotemporal in-situ groundwater-level measurements are essential for sustainable water management. Despite their importance, lack of harmonized, quality-controlled datasets has hindered large-scale groundwater studies in Brazil. In collaboration with the Geological Survey of Brazil, we present the Groundwater Well Database for Brazil (GWDBrazil), which consolidates and standardizes information from over 351,000 wells, with records dating from 1900 to 2024, including about 450 wells with continuous daily monitoring from 2010 to 2024. Cross-verification steps were applied to ensure data accuracy. GWDBrazil is available in both tabular format and vector points, comprising information such as location, well depth, and well purpose. The dataset also provides data to support integrated surface water and groundwater management, such the distance from each well to the nearest river and aquifer information. This dataset is intended to serve as a valuable resource for researchers, decision-makers, and stakeholders, providing essential information to support comprehensive water management strategies in Brazil.,Scientific Data
Disentangling climate and policy uncertainties for the Colorado River post-2026 operations,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63635-4,2025-09-29,Lakes Mead and Powell in the Colorado River Basin underpin water and hydropower supply for the western United States. While the policies currently regulating the basin will expire by 2026, planning remains challenging due to intertwined climate variability and policy uncertainties. Based on streamflow projections from 10 dynamically downscaled CMIP6 global climate models and unique methods that add and remove internal variability, we evaluate future conditions at Powell and Mead under existing and alternative policies. Due to projected streamflow declines, under existing policy, both reservoirs will face substantial risks (&gt;80% likelihood) of reaching dead pool before 2060. Adopting recently proposed alternative policies reduces but doesn’t eliminate such risks. All policies also exhibit tipping points where reservoir levels can change rapidly with a slight change in streamflow. A sustainable policy may require larger reductions to further reduce the reservoirs’ dead pool risks and provide better buffers from sudden changes.,Nature Communications
Wing dam effects on water and bed levels in rivers are influenced by bedload type,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02739-7,2025-09-30,Wing dams, used in rivers like the Mississippi and Danube, improve navigation by increasing water depth during low flow. Their hydromorphological effects are complex, and their influence on flood risk remains debated. Here we developed an approach that identifies local physical patterns from detailed numerical calculations, enabling extension to larger river sections and longer time scales previously difficult to study. We apply this numerical method to assess wing dam impacts on water and bed levels over decades to centuries. Our results show that rivers with bed materials prone to armouring tend to experience long-term water level increases due to wing dams, while others may see decreases. Adjustments to new stable conditions take decades, with temporary water level rises even in uniform beds. For the Mississippi River, wing dams likely caused initial water level increases, but effects declined over time, indicating evolving riverbed responses. These findings help design flood risk–optimal wing dam configurations.,Communications Earth & Environment
Synchronization of global peak river discharge since the 1980s,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-025-02427-6,2025-09-30,Riverine floods that occur simultaneously over multiple regions often lead to amplified societal and environmental impacts compared to individual events. However, the pattern and mechanisms governing the global interconnection of peak river discharge across spatially distant and proximate locations remain largely unexplored. Here, on the basis of a global annual peak discharge database from 4,407 observational hydrometric stations, we identify hubs for remotely linked discharge peaks spanning thousands of kilometres. We show increasing trends in the number of remotely linked watersheds and the total drainage area, pointing to amplified synchronization of global peak river discharge since the 1980s. Ocean–atmosphere oscillations, through the perturbation of both temperature and precipitation anomalies, dictate the global coupling pattern and temporal evolution of discharge peaks. Our findings highlight an emergent profile of global peak river flow in a warming climate that can benefit coordinated flood risk management.,Nature Climate Change
Interception reduction from deforestation and forest fire increases large-scale fluvial flooding risk,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02748-6,2025-10-01,Catastrophic flooding has been noted to occur with greater frequency following deforestation, but limited observations have been available to test this connection over large spatial scales. Here we used the data of mega forest fires impacting a region of 25,000 km<sup>2</sup> in Australia exhibiting rapid loss in forest canopy, where the runoff generation has been carefully observed with minimum anthropogenic influences for more than half a century. This provides a unique opportunity to assess the impact of the forest canopy loss on large-scale fluvial flooding. A state-controlled hypothesis test, with the climate and watershed states controlled to enhance robustness, shows a statistically significant increase in annual maximum flows resulting from the forest loss treatment. The reasoning for this natural experiment is that the forest loss impact on the interception potential of forest canopy, fallen leaves, and root-zone soils in wide region could have a recognizable impact on the fluvial flood.,Communications Earth & Environment
Disrupted geomorphic and biotic stream connectivity in paraglacial regions,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02812-1,2025-10-01,Ecological and geomorphic theory assume longitudinal connectivity; here, we test whether these concepts apply in naturally disconnected paraglacial stream networks with lakes and coarse glacial sediment. We determined downstream hydraulic geometry relationships (DHG) for channel width; riparian vegetation was inventoried across process domains (rapids, flats, lakes) over 10 km in two northern Swedish catchments—one above and one below the former highest coastline (FHC). Below the FHC, finer sediment from marine/deltaic deposition may allow more stream self-adjustment. DHG relationships were weak overall, with large local width variation, but slightly stronger in the FHC-below catchment, where a lake-effect was found, with wider channels downstream of lakes. Riparian vegetation species density did not substantially increase downstream as in connected stream networks, and vegetation similarity between reaches was weakly related to distance, suggesting disrupted dispersal. These findings indicate that formerly glaciated catchments are highly fragmented, with local factors dominating geomorphic and ecological patterns.,Communications Earth & Environment
Quality controlled, reliable groundwater level data with corresponding specific yield over India,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05899-5,2025-10-01,Groundwater is a vital resource for domestic, agricultural, and industrial use, with its demand growing due to population growth and climate change. Several studies have identified groundwater depleting in India at unsustainable rate over North-west part, but a contrasting trend is observed in the southern India. To better study groundwater dynamics quality-controlled and reliable well data is essential, which is missing. Here we process seasonal groundwater levels from 32,299 wells across India to obtain reliable well data and provide respective specific yields. Initially, wells with no data and negative values are removed. Later three-sigma method is imposed on each well to eliminate outliers. Finally, wells with at least two values per year, with no value repeating more than twice consecutively, are retained, resulting in 2,759 reliable wells. We used vectorization-based method to classify aquifer types and estimated specific yields based on hydrogeological map. We also provide open access to data and scripts so that researchers can study groundwater variations, compare GRACE and model-based groundwater estimates against in-situ well data.,Scientific Data
Strategizing renewable energy transitions to preserve sediment transport integrity,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-025-01626-5,2025-09-26,Hydropower is vital for climate mitigation by enabling low-carbon energy systems, but hydropower dams also trap sediment, a crucial resource for ecosystems and climate adaptation along downstream coastlines. Here we present a multisectoral integrated water–sediment–energy planning framework that fully internalizes the impacts of hydropower expansion, both on energy system costs and on foregone ecosystem services from reduced sediment supply for the Mekong River Basin. Our analysis indicates that full development of large hydropower could reduce sediment flows to the Mekong Delta by 41.2 ± 6.6 megatonnes per year (75 ± 9%). However, strategically replacing 19 high-sediment-trapping hydropower plants with solar, wind and energy storage alternatives could preserve up to 98% of sediment supply, with only a 4–6% (US$15.7–26.0 billion) increase in energy system costs over 2020–2050. Crucially, when sediment-related benefits—valued at US$12–28 million per megatonne per year—are considered, the additional costs of preserving sediment supply are nearly offset. The proposed framework offers a transferable approach to support sustainable low-carbon energy transitions while safeguarding sediment-dependent ecosystems worldwide.,Nature Sustainability
Direct human interventions drive spatial variability in long-term peak streamflow trends across the United States,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02738-8,2025-09-29,Understanding non-stationarity in annual peakflow is critical amid climate change and human interventions<sup>1,2</sup>. We analyzed trends in peakflow across 3907 streamflow sites with a median record length of 80 years in the continental United States. Results showed that one-third of the sites have significant trends. Of these, two-thirds showed decreasing trends nationwide, while one-third showed increasing trends in the Northeast and Great Lakes regions. We found urbanization and water management as primary drivers, with agriculture and climate as secondary. Urbanization explained up to 62% of the variance in Texas-Gulf, 44% in California, and 32% in the Mid-Atlantic regions. Water management dominated in Tennessee (37%) and Ohio (30%) regions. Agriculture was most influential in the Great Lakes (17%) region, while climate contributed in the Rio Grande (15%) and California (11%) regions. Although the latest climate model provides many realizations, it inadequately captures direct human interventions in the water system.,Communications Earth & Environment
National soil hydrologic groups map for environmental applications using data-driven and expert-based methods,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05853-5,2025-09-29,Regional and national 3D soil hydraulic maps enhance understanding of soil hydraulic properties, essential for environmental assessments. However, data aggregation is often necessary in large-scale models to facilitate the modelling of complex soil characteristics. This study presents a soil hydrologic groups map for Hungary, derived through k-means clustering and expert-based rules. Clustering was applied to the 100 m resolution 3D HU-SoilHydroGrids database, considering eight hydraulic parameters across six depths. The accuracy of these maps is limited for rare soil types with extreme characteristics due to their small spatial extent and sparse representation in national datasets. To account for these underrepresented soil types, we refined each statistics-based cluster using expert-based rules incorporating soil profile depth, genetic type, electrical conductivity, and exchangeable sodium content. The final classification includes 68 soil hydrologic groups, defined by distinct hydraulic properties, such as van Genuchten parameters to describe water retention, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. This national map supports country-wide hydrological modelling, environmental management, and agricultural planning in Hungary by enabling consistent treatment of similar soils.,Scientific Data
A groundwater well database for Brazil (GWDBrazil),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05843-7,2025-09-29,Sufficient spatiotemporal in-situ groundwater-level measurements are essential for sustainable water management. Despite their importance, lack of harmonized, quality-controlled datasets has hindered large-scale groundwater studies in Brazil. In collaboration with the Geological Survey of Brazil, we present the Groundwater Well Database for Brazil (GWDBrazil), which consolidates and standardizes information from over 351,000 wells, with records dating from 1900 to 2024, including about 450 wells with continuous daily monitoring from 2010 to 2024. Cross-verification steps were applied to ensure data accuracy. GWDBrazil is available in both tabular format and vector points, comprising information such as location, well depth, and well purpose. The dataset also provides data to support integrated surface water and groundwater management, such the distance from each well to the nearest river and aquifer information. This dataset is intended to serve as a valuable resource for researchers, decision-makers, and stakeholders, providing essential information to support comprehensive water management strategies in Brazil.,Scientific Data

In collaboration with the Geological Survey of Brazil, we present the Groundwater Well Database for Brazil (GWDBrazil), which consolidates and standardizes information from over 351,000 wells, with records dating from 1900 to 2024, including about 450 wells with continuous daily monitoring from 2010 to 2024. Cross-verification steps were applied to ensure data accuracy. GWDBrazil is available in both tabular format and vector points, comprising information such as location, well depth, and well purpose. The dataset also provides data to support integrated surface water and groundwater management, such the distance from each well to the nearest river and aquifer information. This dataset is intended to serve as a valuable resource for researchers, decision-makers, and stakeholders, providing essential information to support comprehensive water management strategies in Brazil.,Scientific Data
Disentangling climate and policy uncertainties for the Colorado River post-2026 operations,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63635-4,2025-09-29,Lakes Mead and Powell in the Colorado River Basin underpin water and hydropower supply for the western United States. While the policies currently regulating the basin will expire by 2026, planning remains challenging due to intertwined climate variability and policy uncertainties. Based on streamflow projections from 10 dynamically downscaled CMIP6 global climate models and unique methods that add and remove internal variability, we evaluate future conditions at Powell and Mead under existing and alternative policies. Due to projected streamflow declines, under existing policy, both reservoirs will face substantial risks (&gt;80% likelihood) of reaching dead pool before 2060. Adopting recently proposed alternative policies reduces but doesn’t eliminate such risks. All policies also exhibit tipping points where reservoir levels can change rapidly with a slight change in streamflow. A sustainable policy may require larger reductions to further reduce the reservoirs’ dead pool risks and provide better buffers from sudden changes.,Nature Communications
Wing dam effects on water and bed levels in rivers are influenced by bedload type,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02739-7,2025-09-30,Wing dams, used in rivers like the Mississippi and Danube, improve navigation by increasing water depth during low flow. Their hydromorphological effects are complex, and their influence on flood risk remains debated. Here we developed an approach that identifies local physical patterns from detailed numerical calculations, enabling extension to larger river sections and longer time scales previously difficult to study. We apply this numerical method to assess wing dam impacts on water and bed levels over decades to centuries. Our results show that rivers with bed materials prone to armouring tend to experience long-term water level increases due to wing dams, while others may see decreases. Adjustments to new stable conditions take decades, with temporary water level rises even in uniform beds. For the Mississippi River, wing dams likely caused initial water level increases, but effects declined over time, indicating evolving riverbed responses. These findings help design flood risk–optimal wing dam configurations.,Communications Earth & Environment
Synchronization of global peak river discharge since the 1980s,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-025-02427-6,2025-09-30,Riverine floods that occur simultaneously over multiple regions often lead to amplified societal and environmental impacts compared to individual events. However, the pattern and mechanisms governing the global interconnection of peak river discharge across spatially distant and proximate locations remain largely unexplored. Here, on the basis of a global annual peak discharge database from 4,407 observational hydrometric stations, we identify hubs for remotely linked discharge peaks spanning thousands of kilometres. We show increasing trends in the number of remotely linked watersheds and the total drainage area, pointing to amplified synchronization of global peak river discharge since the 1980s. Ocean–atmosphere oscillations, through the perturbation of both temperature and precipitation anomalies, dictate the global coupling pattern and temporal evolution of discharge peaks. Our findings highlight an emergent profile of global peak river flow in a warming climate that can benefit coordinated flood risk management.,Nature Climate Change
Interception reduction from deforestation and forest fire increases large-scale fluvial flooding risk,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02748-6,2025-10-01,Catastrophic flooding has been noted to occur with greater frequency following deforestation, but limited observations have been available to test this connection over large spatial scales. Here we used the data of mega forest fires impacting a region of 25,000 km<sup>2</sup> in Australia exhibiting rapid loss in forest canopy, where the runoff generation has been carefully observed with minimum anthropogenic influences for more than half a century. This provides a unique opportunity to assess the impact of the forest canopy loss on large-scale fluvial flooding. A state-controlled hypothesis test, with the climate and watershed states controlled to enhance robustness, shows a statistically significant increase in annual maximum flows resulting from the forest loss treatment. The reasoning for this natural experiment is that the forest loss impact on the interception potential of forest canopy, fallen leaves, and root-zone soils in wide region could have a recognizable impact on the fluvial flood.,Communications Earth & Environment
Disrupted geomorphic and biotic stream connectivity in paraglacial regions,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02812-1,2025-10-01,Ecological and geomorphic theory assume longitudinal connectivity; here, we test whether these concepts apply in naturally disconnected paraglacial stream networks with lakes and coarse glacial sediment. We determined downstream hydraulic geometry relationships (DHG) for channel width; riparian vegetation was inventoried across process domains (rapids, flats, lakes) over 10 km in two northern Swedish catchments—one above and one below the former highest coastline (FHC). Below the FHC, finer sediment from marine/deltaic deposition may allow more stream self-adjustment. DHG relationships were weak overall, with large local width variation, but slightly stronger in the FHC-below catchment, where a lake-effect was found, with wider channels downstream of lakes. Riparian vegetation species density did not substantially increase downstream as in connected stream networks, and vegetation similarity between reaches was weakly related to distance, suggesting disrupted dispersal. These findings indicate that formerly glaciated catchments are highly fragmented, with local factors dominating geomorphic and ecological patterns.,Communications Earth & Environment
Quality controlled, reliable groundwater level data with corresponding specific yield over India,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05899-5,2025-10-01,Groundwater is a vital resource for domestic, agricultural, and industrial use, with its demand growing due to population growth and climate change. Several studies have identified groundwater depleting in India at unsustainable rate over North-west part, but a contrasting trend is observed in the southern India. To better study groundwater dynamics quality-controlled and reliable well data is essential, which is missing. Here we process seasonal groundwater levels from 32,299 wells across India to obtain reliable well data and provide respective specific yields. Initially, wells with no data and negative values are removed. Later three-sigma method is imposed on each well to eliminate outliers. Finally, wells with at least two values per year, with no value repeating more than twice consecutively, are retained, resulting in 2,759 reliable wells. We used vectorization-based method to classify aquifer types and estimated specific yields based on hydrogeological map. We also provide open access to data and scripts so that researchers can study groundwater variations, compare GRACE and model-based groundwater estimates against in-situ well data.,Scientific Data
Strategizing renewable energy transitions to preserve sediment transport integrity,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-025-01626-5,2025-09-26,Hydropower is vital for climate mitigation by enabling low-carbon energy systems, but hydropower dams also trap sediment, a crucial resource for ecosystems and climate adaptation along downstream coastlines. Here we present a multisectoral integrated water–sediment–energy planning framework that fully internalizes the impacts of hydropower expansion, both on energy system costs and on foregone ecosystem services from reduced sediment supply for the Mekong River Basin. Our analysis indicates that full development of large hydropower could reduce sediment flows to the Mekong Delta by 41.2 ± 6.6 megatonnes per year (75 ± 9%). However, strategically replacing 19 high-sediment-trapping hydropower plants with solar, wind and energy storage alternatives could preserve up to 98% of sediment supply, with only a 4–6% (US$15.7–26.0 billion) increase in energy system costs over 2020–2050. Crucially, when sediment-related benefits—valued at US$12–28 million per megatonne per year—are considered, the additional costs of preserving sediment supply are nearly offset. The proposed framework offers a transferable approach to support sustainable low-carbon energy transitions while safeguarding sediment-dependent ecosystems worldwide.,Nature Sustainability
Direct human interventions drive spatial variability in long-term peak streamflow trends across the United States,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02738-8,2025-09-29,Understanding non-stationarity in annual peakflow is critical amid climate change and human interventions<sup>1,2</sup>. We analyzed trends in peakflow across 3907 streamflow sites with a median record length of 80 years in the continental United States. Results showed that one-third of the sites have significant trends. Of these, two-thirds showed decreasing trends nationwide, while one-third showed increasing trends in the Northeast and Great Lakes regions. We found urbanization and water management as primary drivers, with agriculture and climate as secondary. Urbanization explained up to 62% of the variance in Texas-Gulf, 44% in California, and 32% in the Mid-Atlantic regions. Water management dominated in Tennessee (37%) and Ohio (30%) regions. Agriculture was most influential in the Great Lakes (17%) region, while climate contributed in the Rio Grande (15%) and California (11%) regions. Although the latest climate model provides many realizations, it inadequately captures direct human interventions in the water system.,Communications Earth & Environment
National soil hydrologic groups map for environmental applications using data-driven and expert-based methods,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05853-5,2025-09-29,Regional and national 3D soil hydraulic maps enhance understanding of soil hydraulic properties, essential for environmental assessments. However, data aggregation is often necessary in large-scale models to facilitate the modelling of complex soil characteristics. This study presents a soil hydrologic groups map for Hungary, derived through k-means clustering and expert-based rules. Clustering was applied to the 100 m resolution 3D HU-SoilHydroGrids database, considering eight hydraulic parameters across six depths. The accuracy of these maps is limited for rare soil types with extreme characteristics due to their small spatial extent and sparse representation in national datasets. To account for these underrepresented soil types, we refined each statistics-based cluster using expert-based rules incorporating soil profile depth, genetic type, electrical conductivity, and exchangeable sodium content. The final classification includes 68 soil hydrologic groups, defined by distinct hydraulic properties, such as van Genuchten parameters to describe water retention, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. This national map supports country-wide hydrological modelling, environmental management, and agricultural planning in Hungary by enabling consistent treatment of similar soils.,Scientific Data

Scalable, adaptive and risk-informed design of hydrological sensor networks,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-025-00496-7,2025-10-07,Stream monitoring networks are essential for understanding and managing Earth’s water resources, yet their deployment is rarely coordinated at the system scale to meet these objectives. We present a data-driven framework for the design of streamflow monitoring networks that improves hydrological predictions while also accommodating socio-environmental constraints. This approach uses a rank-revealing QR decomposition to isolate monitoring sites that best capture the spatiotemporal structure of hydrological time series obtained from retrospective simulations. Evaluated using 44 years of reanalysis data, we find that our sensor placement approach enables better reconstructions of streamflow at ungauged locations compared with existing methods. Our approach accommodates incremental expansion of existing gauge networks and integrates operational priorities, such as flood risk, without compromising the accuracy of hydrological predictions. Demonstrated across diverse hydrological regimes, this framework provides a scalable and robust method for gauge network design that will empower water managers to make more informed decisions.,Nature Water
Climate change and human activities amplify runoff variability risks in lower reaches of large rivers,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02759-3,2025-10-07,The contributions of climate change and human activities to runoff variation have been examined in multiple individual catchments, but upstream-downstream interaction relationships remain underexplored. Here, we propose a three-tiered attribution framework to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns, underlying drivers, and upstream-downstream relationships of runoff variations in the Yellow River Basin (1952–2021). The results indicate that the longitudinal cumulative effects of climatic (ranging from −8.6% upstream to 7.1% downstream relative to the whole basin) and anthropogenic disturbance (15.2%-92.9%) factors lead to higher risks of runoff variations in downstream regions, with more pronounced seasonal fluctuations (particularly in reservoir-regulated reaches). Glaciers, lakes, and reservoirs’ storage capacities cause lagged effects of climate change and human activities on runoff variations, while simultaneously serving as critical drivers for inter-basin water resource regulation. Integrating comprehensive understanding of multi-scale hydrological variability drivers and spatial interaction mechanisms is essential for advancing adaptive river basin management and sustainable water resources allocation.,Communications Earth & Environment
Causal pathways underlying global soil moisture–precipitation coupling,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63999-7,2025-10-08,Surface soil moisture–precipitation (SSM–P) coupling involves complex processes, with sensible heat (SH) and evapotranspiration as important mediators. However, these coupling pathways and their underlying mechanisms across the globe remain unclear, limiting hydrometeorological predictions and projections. Here, we employ an information flow technique to satellite observations and reanalysis, revealing strong local SSM impacts on precipitation across ~16% of analyzed global land. Among the eight identified coupling hotspots, the SH-mediated pathway emerges as a crucial mechanism, except for two African hotspots dominated by the evapotranspiration-mediated pathway. These pathway differences are linked to remote moisture availability and boundary layer height variability. Strong coupling preferentially occurs over regions with large SSM variability, particularly for SSM–SH–P. Most CMIP6 models fail to reproduce these coupling patterns, with only four successfully capturing the ERA5-derived variability–causality relationship. Our study offers additional insights into land–atmosphere coupling and proposes process-based metrics for model evaluation.,Nature Communications
3D-LAKES: Three-Dimensional Global Lake and Reservoir Bathymetry from ICESat-2 Altimetry and Landsat Imagery,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05911-y,2025-10-08,Quantification of the water storage dynamics in global lakes and reservoirs is pivotal for understanding the roles of surface water in regional climatology, mitigating natural disasters, and preserving ecosystems. However, the ability to accurately comprehend these storage dynamics is significantly hindered by the lack of reliable and cost-effective global bathymetry information. This study introduces the 3D-LAKES dataset, which contains the area-elevation (A-E) relationship and three-dimensional (3D) bathymetry information for 510,530 global lakes and reservoirs, representing 98.9% of global surface water storage capacity. This dataset was validated using 214 A-E relationships and 12 bathymetry maps collected from in-situ measurements, showing strong agreement. The A-E relationships yield an RMSE of 0.60 m, a NRMSE of 0.14, and an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.61; while the 3D bathymetry maps have an RMSE of 1.37 m and a NRMSE of 0.26. This dataset has the potential to support many applications, from monitoring lake/reservoir storage variations to parameterizing hydraulic/hydrological models. Such integration provides essential information for global hydrological studies, water management programs, and disaster mitigation.,Scientific Data

Validation used household agriculture surveys in India (N = 8,355) and a U.S. well database (N = 1,505,371). In the U.S., our method achieved 85% accuracy in distinguishing groundwater use within 2 km of wells – substantially higher than GMIA (25%). In India’s groundwater-dominated regions, our estimates performed comparably to GMIA (73% vs. 72%). These results suggest our dataset offers a more accurate and spatially detailed representation of irrigation water sources, enabling improved analysis of agricultural water use.,Scientific Data
Moisture and temperature sources were key drivers of the anomalies for the record-breaking of 2023 Amazon drought,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02771-7,2025-10-09,The record-breaking 2022–24 Amazon-drought, which extended into the Orinoco and Cerrado regions, was characterized by severe-dry conditions during the dry-to-wet transition-season of the 2023–24 hydrological years (September-November/2023). This situation was not driven by a moisture-deficit from either remote sources or the region itself, although oceanic moisture sources exhibited negative anomalies. It was caused by the prevailing atmospheric stability, which inhibited convection and therefore precipitation in this region, and by extremely high temperatures having as its main driver the transition from 2022–23 La Niña to 2023–24 El Niño, which amplified the anomalies in the variables. Although atmospheric moisture was anomalously high, it was insufficient to compensate for the high temperatures, which led to reduced relative humidity values and enhanced atmospheric evaporative demand. Moisture that did not precipitate in the region was transported to areas where there was sufficient instability for convection, resulting in high precipitation and floods in the Uruguay/Brazilian-South-Atlantic-Marginal river basins in September-October/2023. The temperature anomaly over the target region had two sources: a local one contributing to warming and an external one contributing to cooling. The results show the importance of adiabatic warming due to subsidence in the region itself and outside the region.,Communications Earth & Environment
Synoptic systems influence the effectiveness of spectral nudging in high-resolution simulations of extreme precipitation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01224-4,2025-10-10,Spectral nudging (SN) is an effective numerical technique that prevents the background field from deviating excessively from the boundary conditions in regional climate modeling. This study investigates the effectiveness of SN in convection-permitting model simulations of three typical events of warm-season extreme precipitation in South Korea. The case studies show that SN improves extreme precipitation simulations by keeping synoptic circulations more consistent with observations. Trajectory analysis also shows that SN influences the moisture transport and local ascent that trigger extreme precipitation. However, the extent of the improvement depends on the synoptic condition and the domain size. The influence of SN generally increases with increasing domain size, especially for events driven by the developing upper-level trough with strong baroclinic instability compared to those influenced by surface processes. SN is also found to be more effective in events whose dominant wave scales fall between the domain size and the cut-off wavelength used for SN. Based on a series of sensitivity experiments, it is proposed that the most effective configuration for simulating extreme precipitation events is to apply SN to a domain approximately 3000 km wide.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
A Comprehensive Water Chemistry Dataset for Iranian Rivers,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05932-7,2025-10-15,River water quality data are essential for managing surface water resources and protecting terrestrial-aquatic ecosystems. While the number of compiled global river water quality datasets is growing, there is a notable lack of available data in Asian countries, especially Iran. To address this gap, this study compiled a comprehensive water chemistry dataset for Iranian rivers covering 1964–2020. The dataset includes 14 chemical compounds and 11 water quality indices, totaling 5,968,568 records (i.e., distinct measurement points × variables × time steps) obtained from 1,591 monitoring stations across the country’s rivers. Our avialable chemical compounds include total dissolved solids, pH, electrical conductivity, carbonate, chloride, bicarbonate, sulfate, calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium, nitrate, ΣCations, and ΣAnions. The calculated water quality indices in our dataset were sodium adsorption ratio, Larson index, sodium percentage, Kelly’s ratio, total hardness, residual sodium carbonates, magnesium hazard, chloro-alkaline index, corrosivity ratio, permeability index, and saturation index. This dataset can support large-scale river water quality assessment studies at the national level and complement the available global river water quality databases.,Scientific Data
Distinct hydrologic response patterns and trends worldwide revealed by physics-embedded learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-64367-1,2025-10-15,To track rapid changes within our water sector, Global Water Models (GWMs) need to realistically represent hydrologic systems’ response patterns — such as the baseflow fraction of streamflow — but are hindered by their limited ability to learn from data. Here we introduce a high-resolution, physics-embedded, big-data-trained model to reliably capture characteristic hydrologic response patterns (signatures) and their shifts. By realistically representing the long-term water balance, the model revealed widespread shifts — in some cases, more than 20% over 20 years — in fundamental green-blue-water partitioning and baseflow ratios worldwide. Shifts in these previously-assumed-static response patterns contributed to increasing flood risks in northern mid-latitudes, heightening water supply stresses in southern subtropical regions, and declining freshwater inputs to many European estuaries, all with ecological implications. With substantially more accurate simulations at monthly and daily scales than current operational systems, this next-generation model resolves large, nonlinear, seasonal runoff responses to rainfall (elasticity) and streamflow flashiness in semi-arid and arid regions. Our results highlight regions with management challenges due to large water supply variability and high climate sensitivity, and demonstrate an advanced tool to forecast seasonal water availability. This capability enables global-scale models to deliver reliable and locally-relevant insights for water management.,Nature Communications
Hydroclimate and landscape diversity drive highly variable greenhouse gas emissions from tropical and subtropical inland waters,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-025-00522-8,2025-10-17,(Sub)tropical inland waters are important greenhouse gas (GHG) sources, yet limited observations have long hindered broad analyses of GHG variability across this diverse region. Here, through a meta-analysis, we have examined the rates and drivers of GHG emissions from flowing and standing (sub)tropical inland waters. We find considerable spatial variation in fluxes, largely related to differences in hydroclimate, geomorphology, land cover and human disturbance. Flowing waters emit more carbon dioxide (3,387

Comprehensive portfolio of adaptation measures to safeguard against evolving flood risks in a changing climate,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02779-z,2025-10-17,Flooding exacerbated by climate change presents growing risks to communities worldwide. Despite extensive research on flood risk, there is a lack of critical analysis of flood adaptation measures spanning traditional and emerging methods. Here, we compile a comprehensive portfolio of 39 adaptation measures classified into four groups: infrastructural/technological, institutional, behavioral/cultural, and nature-based measures. Each measure is evaluated for its advantages, disadvantages, co-benefits, and tradeoffs. Our analysis identifies four broad eras in the evolution of flood adaptation measures. While early efforts primarily focused on structural modifications, more recent projects shifted toward soft adaptation measures, with a growing interest in employing community-centered and nature-based solutions. We lay out key decision-making attributes to identify successful adaptation strategies that are socially just, practically feasible, and technically sound. Finally, we highlight gaps and provide recommendations for future research, with an emphasis on a transdisciplinary approach toward developing and implementing climate-resilient and equitable flood adaptation strategies.,Communications Earth & Environment
Merging Remote Sensing Derived River Slope Datasets with High-Resolution Hydrofabrics for the United States,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05941-6,2025-10-20,The CONtiguous United States scale (CONUS) Flood Inundation Mapping Hydrofabric - ICESat-2 River Surface Slope (FIM HF IRIS) dataset integrates satellite-derived global IRIS river slopes for 117,357 spatially corresponding main-stream reaches within National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Water Prediction operational FIM forecasting system (OWP HAND-FIM). A spatial joining approach was first developed to align FIM HF and IRIS reaches, addressing differences in reach flowline sources. Original FIM HF slopes had an average bias of 76 ± 168% relative to IRIS slopes. Applying to OWP HAND-FIM, FIM HF IRIS improved FIM accuracy by average 31 ± 25% (CSI) across eight flood events compared to the FIM HF slopes. Using a common attribute, IRIS data were transferred from FIM HF IRIS to the CONUS Next Generation Water Resources Modeling Framework Hydrofabric (NextGen HF), creating the NextGen HF IRIS dataset. Leveraging a common attribute, the resulting datasets enable using SWOT vector data within OWP HAND-FIM and NextGen. The spatial joining approach enabling integrating the hydrofabrics with other hydrologic datasets via flowlines is provided.,Scientific Data
