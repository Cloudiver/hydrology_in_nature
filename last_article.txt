Overlooked discrepancies in protocols undermine coastal restoration practices in China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-01995-x,2025-01-09,To improve the success of expanding ecosystem restoration efforts, technical guiding-standards are being developed in many nations. Whether these protocols have been well adopted to guide restoration practices remains unknown, especially in developing countries where policies evolve rapidly to balance socioeconomic development with ecosystem restoration. By conducting text semantic mining analyses, we reveal widespread discrepancies between China’s coastal restoration practices and protocols over the past four decades. Over 60% of executed restoration projects had no detailed technical standards to guide implementation, especially for severely degraded ecosystems. Development of these standards lagged significantly behind project implementation, was poorly enforced, and focused more on monitoring than guiding good restoration designs and adaptive management, likely undermining restoration performance. Nevertheless, current policies toward prioritizing ecosystem restoration offer opportunities to remedy this issue. Enforcing policies to ensure that practices are guided by protocols is necessary to promote coastal restoration success in China and globally as nations strive to achieve ambitious restoration targets.

Hydroclimate volatility on a warming Earth,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-024-00624-z,2025-01-09,Hydroclimate volatility refers to sudden, large and/or frequent transitions between very dry and very wet conditions. In this Review, we examine how hydroclimate volatility is anticipated to evolve with anthropogenic warming. Using a metric of ‘hydroclimate whiplash’ based on the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, global-averaged subseasonal (3-month) and interannual (12-month) whiplash have increased by 31–66% and 8–31%, respectively, since the mid-twentieth century. Further increases are anticipated with ongoing warming, including subseasonal increases of 113% and interannual increases of 52% over land areas with 3 °C of warming; these changes are largest at high latitudes and from northern Africa eastward into South Asia. Extensive evidence links these increases primarily to thermodynamics, namely the rising water-vapour-holding capacity and potential evaporative demand of the atmosphere. Increases in hydroclimate volatility will amplify hazards associated with rapid swings between wet and dry states (including flash floods, wildfires, landslides and disease outbreaks), and could accelerate a water management shift towards co-management of drought and flood risks. A clearer understanding of plausible future trajectories of hydroclimate volatility requires expanded focus on the response of atmospheric circulation to regional and global forcings, as well as land–ocean–atmosphere feedbacks, using large ensemble climate model simulations, storm-resolving high-resolution models and emerging machine learning methods.

Decoupling of surface water storage from precipitation in global drylands due to anthropogenic activity,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00367-7,2025-01-10,The availability of surface water in global drylands is essential for both human society and ecosystems. However, the long-term drivers of change in surface water storage, particularly those related to anthropogenic activities, remain unclear. Here we use multi-mission remote sensing data to construct monthly time series of water storage changes from 1985 to 2020 for 105,400 lakes and reservoirs in global drylands. An increase of 2.20 km<sup>3</sup> per year in surface water storage is found primarily due to the construction of new reservoirs. For lakes and old reservoirs (constructed before 1983), conversely, the trend in storage is minor when aggregated globally, but they dominate surface water storage trends in 91% of individual global dryland basins. Further analysis reveals that long-term storage changes in these water bodies are primarily linked to anthropogenic factors—including human-induced warming and water-management practices—rather than to precipitation changes, as previously thought. These findings reveal a decoupling of surface water storage from precipitation in global drylands, raising concerns about societal and ecosystem sustainability.

A new look at Earth’s water and energy with SWOT,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00372-w,2025-01-13,As the planet transitions to a new climate, adapting to the Earth’s changing water cycle remains among the top challenges faced by humanity. The relative stability of climate and water resources over the past millennia allowed humans to build complex societies with established agriculture, infrastructure and economies that today sustain the livelihood of eight billion people. As the planet warms, this steady state of water movement is being altered, and both oceanic and terrestrial components of the global water cycle are undergoing measurable changes that will probably continue. Predicting the new trajectory of Earth’s water in a warming climate begins with observing the entire water supply–demand chain across the planet, from Earth’s largest water reservoir, the ocean, to water storage, use and recycling on land. A recently launched space observatory, called the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT), is making a timely entrance and addition to the water-observing networks, by providing direct, high-resolution measurements of the water height and volume of nearly all water on the Earth’s surface. Here we link technological advances in wide-swath satellite altimetry and SWOT’s novel measurements of water volume across the planet to scientific innovations for Earth’s water cycle, including studies of changes in the water storage and dynamics in global lakes and rivers, rising seas, ocean energetics and land–ocean exchange, with implications for practical information for water resource managers and climate resilience efforts. We also discuss how SWOT innovations set the stage for future missions and integrated Earth-system approaches within the water science community.

Episodic warm climates on early Mars primed by crustal hydration,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01626-8,2025-01-15,Geological records indicate that the surface of ancient Mars harboured substantial volumes of liquid water, a resource gradually diminished by processes such as the chemical alteration of crustal materials by hydration and atmospheric escape. However, how a relatively warm climate existed on early Mars to support liquid water under a fainter young Sun is debated. Greenhouse gases such as H<sub>2</sub> in a CO<sub>2</sub>-rich atmosphere could have contributed to warming through collision-induced absorption, but whether sufficient H<sub>2</sub> was available to sustain warming remains unclear. Here we use a combined climate and photochemical model to simulate how atmospheric chemistry on early Mars responded to water–rock reactions and climate variations, as constrained by existing observations. We find that H<sub>2</sub> outgassing from crustal hydration and oxidation, supplemented by transient volcanic activity, could have generated sufficient H<sub>2</sub> fluxes to transiently foster warm, humid climates. We estimate that Mars experienced episodic warm periods of an integrated duration of ~40 million years, with each event lasting ≥10<sup>5</sup> years, consistent with the formation timescale of valley networks. Declining atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> via surface oxidant sinks or variations in the planet’s axial tilt could have led to abrupt shifts in the planet’s redox state and transition to a CO-dominated atmosphere and cold climate.

Hydroclimatic extremes threaten groundwater quality and stability,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-55890-2,2025-01-16,Heavy precipitation, drought, and other hydroclimatic extremes occur more frequently than in the past climate reference period (1961–1990). Given their strong effect on groundwater recharge dynamics, these phenomena increase the vulnerability of groundwater quantity and quality. Over the course of the past decade, we have documented changes in the composition of dissolved organic matter in groundwater. We show that fractions of ingressing surface-derived organic molecules increased significantly as groundwater levels declined, whereas concentrations of dissolved organic carbon remained constant. Molecular composition changeover was accelerated following 2018’s extreme summer drought. These findings demonstrate that hydroclimatic extremes promote rapid transport between surface ecosystems and groundwaters, thereby enabling xenobiotic substances to evade microbial processing, accrue in greater abundance in groundwater, and potentially compromise the safe nature of these potable water sources. Groundwater quality is far more vulnerable to the impact of recent climate anomalies than is currently recognized, and the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter can be used as a comprehensive indicator for groundwater quality deterioration.

Accounting for differences between crops and regions reduces estimates of nitrate leaching from nitrogen-fertilized soils,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02001-0,2025-01-16,Nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>) leaching from nitrogen (N) fertilized soils is a significant global concern, affecting both the environment and public health. However, substantial uncertainties and variabilities in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leaching factors (LFs) among regions or crops impede accurate assessments of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leaching. Here we synthesize 2500 field observations worldwide and show that LFs vary by an order of magnitude across regions and crops, primarily driven by hydroclimatic and edaphic conditions rather than N fertilizer management. Global cropland NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leaching from synthetic N fertilization, calculated through spatially explicit (15.4, 14.8–16.1 Tg N yr<sup>–1</sup>) and crop-specific (12.9, 11.0–14.8 Tg N yr<sup>–1</sup>) LFs, is 41% lower than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Tier 1 global inventory. Over 47% of this leaching is concentrated in China, India, and the United States, with maize, wheat, rice and vegetables accounting for nearly half of it. Improved regional and crop-specific LFs will provide a benchmark for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leaching abatement by pinpointing potential global hotspots.

Gross primary productivity is more sensitive to accelerated flash droughts,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02013-w,2025-01-17,Flash droughts, characterized by their rapid onset, substantially affect terrestrial ecosystems. However, the sensitivity of ecosystem productivity to the rapid development of flash droughts under varying vegetation conditions remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the ecosystem response to the speed of flash drought onset for different plant functional types, considering the decline rate of root-zone soil moisture and standardized gross primary productivity anomaly. Our findings reveal a significant increase of approximately 10% in the proportion of 1- and 2-pentad (5 and 10 days) onset flash droughts leading to negative standardized gross primary productivity anomalies during 2001–2018. Furthermore, while standardized gross primary productivity anomalies decline at higher rates, they do not promptly respond on a shorter timescale to faster-onset flash droughts compared to slower-onset flash droughts. Vegetation types with shallower root systems exhibit higher sensitivities to faster-onset flash droughts, suggesting an escalating threat to terrestrial ecosystems in a changing climate.

Counteracting greenhouse gas and aerosol influences intensify global water seasonality over the past century,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02025-6,2025-01-18,Variations in water availability seasonality significantly impact society and ecosystems. While many studies have focused on mean or extreme precipitation, the response of water availability seasonality, influencing yearly water distribution beyond individual extremes, to human-induced climate change remains underexplored. Here we examine global and regional water availability seasonality changes from 1915 to 2014, quantifying how anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols have influenced these variations using reanalysis and simulations from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. Despite large spatiotemporal uncertainties due to regional variability and model assumptions, we find that greenhouse gases significantly amplify the seasonality, while aerosols reduce it. Given that the positive effects of greenhouse gases surpass the aerosols’ negative effects, the counterbalancing influences have led to an overall enhancement in seasonality of water availability over the past century. This trend is expected to continue in the future as greenhouse gases-induced warming continues to rise and aerosol levels decline.

The first geospatial dataset of irrigated fields (2020–2024) in Vojvodina (Serbia),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04443-9,2025-01-18,Irrigation is a cornerstone of global food security, enabling sustainable agricultural production and helping to ensure that food is available for people around the world, now and in the future. Mapping irrigated fields provides valuable information for sustainable water management, agricultural development, and environmental conservation efforts. However, the collection of high-quality training data, which is necessary for accurate irrigation mapping remains costly and labour-intensive. To address this, we created a georeferenced regional dataset consisting of location, crop type, and occurrence of the irrigation equipment which are essential information for mapping irrigated fields. Four main irrigated crops were considered: maize, soybean, sugar beet, and wheat. The dataset, consisting of a total of 1256 parcels, is created for Vojvodina, the main agricultural area in Serbia, spanning the period of five years (2020–2024). This study’s goal is to give accessibility to our dataset which further can be explored and used for building or fine-tuning machine learning and deep learning models for the automatic detection of irrigated fields using satellite imagery.

Gross primary productivity is more sensitive to accelerated flash droughts,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02013-w,2025-01-17,Flash droughts, characterized by their rapid onset, substantially affect terrestrial ecosystems. However, the sensitivity of ecosystem productivity to the rapid development of flash droughts under varying vegetation conditions remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the ecosystem response to the speed of flash drought onset for different plant functional types, considering the decline rate of root-zone soil moisture and standardized gross primary productivity anomaly. Our findings reveal a significant increase of approximately 10% in the proportion of 1- and 2-pentad (5 and 10 days) onset flash droughts leading to negative standardized gross primary productivity anomalies during 2001–2018. Furthermore, while standardized gross primary productivity anomalies decline at higher rates, they do not promptly respond on a shorter timescale to faster-onset flash droughts compared to slower-onset flash droughts. Vegetation types with shallower root systems exhibit higher sensitivities to faster-onset flash droughts, suggesting an escalating threat to terrestrial ecosystems in a changing climate.

Counteracting greenhouse gas and aerosol influences intensify global water seasonality over the past century,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02025-6,2025-01-18,Variations in water availability seasonality significantly impact society and ecosystems. While many studies have focused on mean or extreme precipitation, the response of water availability seasonality, influencing yearly water distribution beyond individual extremes, to human-induced climate change remains underexplored. Here we examine global and regional water availability seasonality changes from 1915 to 2014, quantifying how anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols have influenced these variations using reanalysis and simulations from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. Despite large spatiotemporal uncertainties due to regional variability and model assumptions, we find that greenhouse gases significantly amplify the seasonality, while aerosols reduce it. Given that the positive effects of greenhouse gases surpass the aerosols’ negative effects, the counterbalancing influences have led to an overall enhancement in seasonality of water availability over the past century. This trend is expected to continue in the future as greenhouse gases-induced warming continues to rise and aerosol levels decline.

The first geospatial dataset of irrigated fields (2020–2024) in Vojvodina (Serbia),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04443-9,2025-01-18,Irrigation is a cornerstone of global food security, enabling sustainable agricultural production and helping to ensure that food is available for people around the world, now and in the future. Mapping irrigated fields provides valuable information for sustainable water management, agricultural development, and environmental conservation efforts. However, the collection of high-quality training data, which is necessary for accurate irrigation mapping remains costly and labour-intensive. To address this, we created a georeferenced regional dataset consisting of location, crop type, and occurrence of the irrigation equipment which are essential information for mapping irrigated fields. Four main irrigated crops were considered: maize, soybean, sugar beet, and wheat. The dataset, consisting of a total of 1256 parcels, is created for Vojvodina, the main agricultural area in Serbia, spanning the period of five years (2020–2024). This study’s goal is to give accessibility to our dataset which further can be explored and used for building or fine-tuning machine learning and deep learning models for the automatic detection of irrigated fields using satellite imagery.

Flood modeling prior to the instrumental era reveals limited magnitude of 1931 Yangtze flood,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00908-1,2025-01-19,The global flood risk urges an improved understanding of flood magnitude and its mechanism, which needs insights from pre-instrumental flood investigations. Due to data scarcity, reconstructing pre-instrumental flood magnitudes relies on statistical downscaling, failing to capture nonlinear and dynamic characteristics. We developed a dynamical approach, NorESM-WRF-SWAT, integrating a global climate, a regional, and a hydrologic model to investigate the 1931 Yangtze River flood (the deadliest in the world) and compared it with the 1998’s. Through validation, our method outperforms the statistical method in simulating precipitations and river discharges. For the first time, we presented detailed insights into the intensity and duration of the 1931 flood, revealing a smaller magnitude but associated with an amplified loss, likely due to social vulnerability and reduced societal resilience compared to the 1998’s. While successful simulation can be interfered with by model variability, our dynamical method shows promise for simulating pre-instrumental flood and building a long-term pre-instrumental-hydrology database.

Hydroclimate volatility on a warming Earth,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-024-00624-z,2025-01-09,Hydroclimate volatility refers to sudden, large and/or frequent transitions between very dry and very wet conditions. In this Review, we examine how hydroclimate volatility is anticipated to evolve with anthropogenic warming. Using a metric of ‘hydroclimate whiplash’ based on the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, global-averaged subseasonal (3-month) and interannual (12-month) whiplash have increased by 31–66% and 8–31%, respectively, since the mid-twentieth century. Further increases are anticipated with ongoing warming, including subseasonal increases of 113% and interannual increases of 52% over land areas with 3 °C of warming; these changes are largest at high latitudes and from northern Africa eastward into South Asia. Extensive evidence links these increases primarily to thermodynamics, namely the rising water-vapour-holding capacity and potential evaporative demand of the atmosphere. Increases in hydroclimate volatility will amplify hazards associated with rapid swings between wet and dry states (including flash floods, wildfires, landslides and disease outbreaks), and could accelerate a water management shift towards co-management of drought and flood risks. A clearer understanding of plausible future trajectories of hydroclimate volatility requires expanded focus on the response of atmospheric circulation to regional and global forcings, as well as land–ocean–atmosphere feedbacks, using large ensemble climate model simulations, storm-resolving high-resolution models and emerging machine learning methods.

Decoupling of surface water storage from precipitation in global drylands due to anthropogenic activity,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00367-7,2025-01-10,The availability of surface water in global drylands is essential for both human society and ecosystems. However, the long-term drivers of change in surface water storage, particularly those related to anthropogenic activities, remain unclear. Here we use multi-mission remote sensing data to construct monthly time series of water storage changes from 1985 to 2020 for 105,400 lakes and reservoirs in global drylands. An increase of 2.20 km<sup>3</sup> per year in surface water storage is found primarily due to the construction of new reservoirs. For lakes and old reservoirs (constructed before 1983), conversely, the trend in storage is minor when aggregated globally, but they dominate surface water storage trends in 91% of individual global dryland basins. Further analysis reveals that long-term storage changes in these water bodies are primarily linked to anthropogenic factors—including human-induced warming and water-management practices—rather than to precipitation changes, as previously thought. These findings reveal a decoupling of surface water storage from precipitation in global drylands, raising concerns about societal and ecosystem sustainability.

A new look at Earth’s water and energy with SWOT,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00372-w,2025-01-13,As the planet transitions to a new climate, adapting to the Earth’s changing water cycle remains among the top challenges faced by humanity. The relative stability of climate and water resources over the past millennia allowed humans to build complex societies with established agriculture, infrastructure and economies that today sustain the livelihood of eight billion people. As the planet warms, this steady state of water movement is being altered, and both oceanic and terrestrial components of the global water cycle are undergoing measurable changes that will probably continue. Predicting the new trajectory of Earth’s water in a warming climate begins with observing the entire water supply–demand chain across the planet, from Earth’s largest water reservoir, the ocean, to water storage, use and recycling on land. A recently launched space observatory, called the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT), is making a timely entrance and addition to the water-observing networks, by providing direct, high-resolution measurements of the water height and volume of nearly all water on the Earth’s surface. Here we link technological advances in wide-swath satellite altimetry and SWOT’s novel measurements of water volume across the planet to scientific innovations for Earth’s water cycle, including studies of changes in the water storage and dynamics in global lakes and rivers, rising seas, ocean energetics and land–ocean exchange, with implications for practical information for water resource managers and climate resilience efforts. We also discuss how SWOT innovations set the stage for future missions and integrated Earth-system approaches within the water science community.

Episodic warm climates on early Mars primed by crustal hydration,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01626-8,2025-01-15,Geological records indicate that the surface of ancient Mars harboured substantial volumes of liquid water, a resource gradually diminished by processes such as the chemical alteration of crustal materials by hydration and atmospheric escape. However, how a relatively warm climate existed on early Mars to support liquid water under a fainter young Sun is debated. Greenhouse gases such as H<sub>2</sub> in a CO<sub>2</sub>-rich atmosphere could have contributed to warming through collision-induced absorption, but whether sufficient H<sub>2</sub> was available to sustain warming remains unclear. Here we use a combined climate and photochemical model to simulate how atmospheric chemistry on early Mars responded to water–rock reactions and climate variations, as constrained by existing observations. We find that H<sub>2</sub> outgassing from crustal hydration and oxidation, supplemented by transient volcanic activity, could have generated sufficient H<sub>2</sub> fluxes to transiently foster warm, humid climates. We estimate that Mars experienced episodic warm periods of an integrated duration of ~40 million years, with each event lasting ≥10<sup>5</sup> years, consistent with the formation timescale of valley networks. Declining atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> via surface oxidant sinks or variations in the planet’s axial tilt could have led to abrupt shifts in the planet’s redox state and transition to a CO-dominated atmosphere and cold climate.

Hydroclimatic extremes threaten groundwater quality and stability,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-55890-2,2025-01-16,Heavy precipitation, drought, and other hydroclimatic extremes occur more frequently than in the past climate reference period (1961–1990). Given their strong effect on groundwater recharge dynamics, these phenomena increase the vulnerability of groundwater quantity and quality. Over the course of the past decade, we have documented changes in the composition of dissolved organic matter in groundwater. We show that fractions of ingressing surface-derived organic molecules increased significantly as groundwater levels declined, whereas concentrations of dissolved organic carbon remained constant. Molecular composition changeover was accelerated following 2018’s extreme summer drought. These findings demonstrate that hydroclimatic extremes promote rapid transport between surface ecosystems and groundwaters, thereby enabling xenobiotic substances to evade microbial processing, accrue in greater abundance in groundwater, and potentially compromise the safe nature of these potable water sources. Groundwater quality is far more vulnerable to the impact of recent climate anomalies than is currently recognized, and the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter can be used as a comprehensive indicator for groundwater quality deterioration.

Accounting for differences between crops and regions reduces estimates of nitrate leaching from nitrogen-fertilized soils,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02001-0,2025-01-16,Nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>) leaching from nitrogen (N) fertilized soils is a significant global concern, affecting both the environment and public health. However, substantial uncertainties and variabilities in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leaching factors (LFs) among regions or crops impede accurate assessments of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leaching. Here we synthesize 2500 field observations worldwide and show that LFs vary by an order of magnitude across regions and crops, primarily driven by hydroclimatic and edaphic conditions rather than N fertilizer management. Global cropland NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leaching from synthetic N fertilization, calculated through spatially explicit (15.4, 14.8–16.1 Tg N yr<sup>–1</sup>) and crop-specific (12.9, 11.0–14.8 Tg N yr<sup>–1</sup>) LFs, is 41% lower than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Tier 1 global inventory.

Improved regional and crop-specific LFs will provide a benchmark for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leaching abatement by pinpointing potential global hotspots.

Emergent constraints on global soil moisture projections under climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02024-7,2025-01-20,Surface soil moisture is projected to decrease under global warming. Such projections are mostly based on climate models, which show large uncertainty (i.e., inter-model spread) partly due to inadequate observational constraint. Here we identify strong physically-based emergent relationships between soil moisture change (2070–2099 minus 1980–2014) and recent air temperature and precipitation trends across an ensemble of climate models. We extend the commonly used univariate Emergent Constraints to a bivariate method and use observed temperature and precipitation trends to constrain global soil moisture changes. Our results show that the bivariate emergent constraints can reduce soil moisture change uncertainty by 7.87%, which is four times more effective than traditional temperature-based univariate constraints. The bivariate emergent constraints change the sign of soil moisture change from negative to positive for semi-arid, dry sub-humid and humid regions and global land as a whole, but exacerbates the drying trend in arid and hyper-arid regions.

Increasing certainty in projected local extreme precipitation change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56235-9,2025-01-20,The latest climate models project widely varying magnitudes of future extreme precipitation changes, thus impeding effective adaptation planning. Many observational constraints have been proposed to reduce the uncertainty of these projections at global to sub-continental scales, but adaptation generally requires detailed, local scale information. Here, we present a temperature-based adaptative emergent constraint strategy combined with data aggregation that reduces the error variance of projected end-of-century changes in annual extremes of daily precipitation under a high emissions scenario by &gt;20% across most areas of the world. These improved projections could benefit nearly 90% of the world’s population by permitting better impact assessment and adaptation planning at local levels. Our physically motivated strategy, which considers the thermodynamic and dynamic components of projected extreme precipitation change, exploits the link between global warming and the thermodynamic component of extreme precipitation. Rigorous cross-validation provides strong evidence of its reliability in constraining local extreme precipitation projections.

Dichotomy retreat and aqueous alteration on Noachian Mars recorded in highland remnants,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01634-8,2025-01-20,The Mawrth Vallis region is a plateau situated on the highland side of Mars’ hemispheric dichotomy boundary. It has a &gt;200-m-thick phyllosilicate-bearing stratigraphic succession that indicates extensive aqueous alteration between 4.1 Ga and 3.7 Ga, during the Noachian Period. In addition, thousands of kilometre-scale isolated mounds in the lowlands north and west of Mawrth Vallis have been identified. Here we use geomorphological and spectroscopic analyses to show that the mounds are erosional remnants that formed through retreat of the highland plateau in the Noachian. Consequently, the escarpment that marks the surface expression of the dichotomy must have receded south-southeast by hundreds of kilometres in this area. Lateral and stratigraphic geochemical variation in the mounds show that widespread, multiphase aqueous alteration occurred in situ across this region in surface and subsurface environments. The mound succession is underlain by a pyroxene-rich unit that represents unaltered material below the regional phyllosilicate-bearing sequence and is unconformably overlain by a thin capping unit that marks the end of large-scale regional aqueous activity. Thus, the mounds contain a stratigraphic record of the onset, evolution and cessation of Noachian aqueous conditions in this region, detailing the environment and climate of Mars at its most habitable.

Projected runoff declines from plant physiological effects on precipitation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00361-z,2025-01-20,The impact of plants on runoff under high atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is a major uncertainty for future water resources. Theory and Earth system models (ESMs) suggest that stricter plant stomatal regulation under high CO<sub>2</sub> will reduce transpiration, potentially boosting runoff. Yet, across a 12-member ensemble of idealized ESM simulations that isolate plant responses to CO<sub>2</sub>, we show that lower transpiration robustly enhances runoff over only 5% of modelled global land area. Precipitation changes are five times more important than transpiration changes in driving runoff responses and are a significant signal of CO<sub>2</sub> physiological forcing over 31–57% of land areas across models. Crucially, ESMs largely disagree on where physiologically forced precipitation changes occur but agree that plant responses in most locations are as likely to reduce runoff as increase it. These results imply that large model uncertainties in precipitation responses, rather than transpiration responses, explain why ESMs disagree on plant physiologically driven runoff changes.

Measurements of groundwater, hydrodynamics, and sand characteristics at a dissipative sea turtle nesting beach,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04455-5,2025-01-21,Beach groundwater and nearshore hydrodynamic data were collected during a field experiment along two dissipative beach transects on Galveston Island, Texas, in the fall of 2023. The monitored beaches serve as nesting habitat for the critically endangered Kemp’s ridley sea turtle. Conditions ranged from calm to stormy, with two storms occurring during the experiment, inundating the entire beach up to the dune toe. Collected hydrodynamic data include readings from pressure loggers submerged in the foreshore and mounted in groundwater wells in the backshore, data from two wave buoys about 1.5 km offshore, and GoPro timestacks of the instantaneous waterline (wave runup). Other collected data include bathymetry and topography surveys, subsurface temperature and moisture content readings, and sediment characteristics. This comprehensive dataset can be used to (1) study relevant beach inundation and groundwater processes, including their effect on the local ecosystem (e.g., repeated flooding of sea turtle nests), (2) study the propagation of nearshore hydrodynamic processes into the beach matrix and groundwater table, and (3) validate existing beach groundwater models.

GEM-Hydro achieves satisfactory simulations of various hydrologic variables when compared to reference datasets. This dataset can be used for example to drive any routing model, compute climatologies or statistics for different hydrologic variables and study their variability as a function of the local geo-morphology, etc.

Flood modeling prior to the instrumental era reveals limited magnitude of 1931 Yangtze flood,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00908-1,2025-01-19,The global flood risk urges an improved understanding of flood magnitude and its mechanism, which needs insights from pre-instrumental flood investigations. Due to data scarcity, reconstructing pre-instrumental flood magnitudes relies on statistical downscaling, failing to capture nonlinear and dynamic characteristics. We developed a dynamical approach, NorESM-WRF-SWAT, integrating a global climate, a regional, and a hydrologic model to investigate the 1931 Yangtze River flood (the deadliest in the world) and compared it with the 1998’s. Through validation, our method outperforms the statistical method in simulating precipitations and river discharges. For the first time, we presented detailed insights into the intensity and duration of the 1931 flood, revealing a smaller magnitude but associated with an amplified loss, likely due to social vulnerability and reduced societal resilience compared to the 1998’s. While successful simulation can be interfered with by model variability, our dynamical method shows promise for simulating pre-instrumental flood and building a long-term pre-instrumental-hydrology database.

Emergent constraints on global soil moisture projections under climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02024-7,2025-01-20,Surface soil moisture is projected to decrease under global warming. Such projections are mostly based on climate models, which show large uncertainty (i.e., inter-model spread) partly due to inadequate observational constraint. Here we identify strong physically-based emergent relationships between soil moisture change (2070–2099 minus 1980–2014) and recent air temperature and precipitation trends across an ensemble of climate models. We extend the commonly used univariate Emergent Constraints to a bivariate method and use observed temperature and precipitation trends to constrain global soil moisture changes. Our results show that the bivariate emergent constraints can reduce soil moisture change uncertainty by 7.87%, which is four times more effective than traditional temperature-based univariate constraints. The bivariate emergent constraints change the sign of soil moisture change from negative to positive for semi-arid, dry sub-humid and humid regions and global land as a whole, but exacerbates the drying trend in arid and hyper-arid regions.

Increasing certainty in projected local extreme precipitation change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56235-9,2025-01-20,The latest climate models project widely varying magnitudes of future extreme precipitation changes, thus impeding effective adaptation planning. Many observational constraints have been proposed to reduce the uncertainty of these projections at global to sub-continental scales, but adaptation generally requires detailed, local scale information. Here, we present a temperature-based adaptative emergent constraint strategy combined with data aggregation that reduces the error variance of projected end-of-century changes in annual extremes of daily precipitation under a high emissions scenario by &gt;20% across most areas of the world. These improved projections could benefit nearly 90% of the world’s population by permitting better impact assessment and adaptation planning at local levels. Our physically motivated strategy, which considers the thermodynamic and dynamic components of projected extreme precipitation change, exploits the link between global warming and the thermodynamic component of extreme precipitation. Rigorous cross-validation provides strong evidence of its reliability in constraining local extreme precipitation projections.

Dichotomy retreat and aqueous alteration on Noachian Mars recorded in highland remnants,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01634-8,2025-01-20,The Mawrth Vallis region is a plateau situated on the highland side of Mars’ hemispheric dichotomy boundary. It has a &gt;200-m-thick phyllosilicate-bearing stratigraphic succession that indicates extensive aqueous alteration between 4.1 Ga and 3.7 Ga, during the Noachian Period. In addition, thousands of kilometre-scale isolated mounds in the lowlands north and west of Mawrth Vallis have been identified. Here we use geomorphological and spectroscopic analyses to show that the mounds are erosional remnants that formed through retreat of the highland plateau in the Noachian. Consequently, the escarpment that marks the surface expression of the dichotomy must have receded south-southeast by hundreds of kilometres in this area. Lateral and stratigraphic geochemical variation in the mounds show that widespread, multiphase aqueous alteration occurred in situ across this region in surface and subsurface environments. The mound succession is underlain by a pyroxene-rich unit that represents unaltered material below the regional phyllosilicate-bearing sequence and is unconformably overlain by a thin capping unit that marks the end of large-scale regional aqueous activity. Thus, the mounds contain a stratigraphic record of the onset, evolution and cessation of Noachian aqueous conditions in this region, detailing the environment and climate of Mars at its most habitable.

Projected runoff declines from plant physiological effects on precipitation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00361-z,2025-01-20,The impact of plants on runoff under high atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is a major uncertainty for future water resources. Theory and Earth system models (ESMs) suggest that stricter plant stomatal regulation under high CO<sub>2</sub> will reduce transpiration, potentially boosting runoff. Yet, across a 12-member ensemble of idealized ESM simulations that isolate plant responses to CO<sub>2</sub>, we show that lower transpiration robustly enhances runoff over only 5% of modelled global land area. Precipitation changes are five times more important than transpiration changes in driving runoff responses and are a significant signal of CO<sub>2</sub> physiological forcing over 31–57% of land areas across models. Crucially, ESMs largely disagree on where physiologically forced precipitation changes occur but agree that plant responses in most locations are as likely to reduce runoff as increase it. These results imply that large model uncertainties in precipitation responses, rather than transpiration responses, explain why ESMs disagree on plant physiologically driven runoff changes.

Measurements of groundwater, hydrodynamics, and sand characteristics at a dissipative sea turtle nesting beach,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04455-5,2025-01-21,Beach groundwater and nearshore hydrodynamic data were collected during a field experiment along two dissipative beach transects on Galveston Island, Texas, in the fall of 2023. The monitored beaches serve as nesting habitat for the critically endangered Kemp’s ridley sea turtle. Conditions ranged from calm to stormy, with two storms occurring during the experiment, inundating the entire beach up to the dune toe. Collected hydrodynamic data include readings from pressure loggers submerged in the foreshore and mounted in groundwater wells in the backshore, data from two wave buoys about 1.5 km offshore, and GoPro timestacks of the instantaneous waterline (wave runup). Other collected data include bathymetry and topography surveys, subsurface temperature and moisture content readings, and sediment characteristics. This comprehensive dataset can be used to (1) study relevant beach inundation and groundwater processes, including their effect on the local ecosystem (e.g., repeated flooding of sea turtle nests), (2) study the propagation of nearshore hydrodynamic processes into the beach matrix and groundwater table, and (3) validate existing beach groundwater models.

The dataset covers the basins of the Laurentian Great Lakes and the Ottawa River and extends over the period 2001–2018. The data consist of all variables (hourly fluxes and state variables) related to the water balance of GEM-Hydro’s land-surface scheme (including precipitation, surface and sub-surface runoff, drainage, evaporation, snow water equivalent, soil moisture…) and mean daily streamflow at 212 gauge locations. These outputs were simulated with a calibrated version of the GEM-Hydro model that was run in open-loop mode (no assimilation) and driven with atmospheric forcings coming from ECCC’s Canadian Surface Reanalysis version 2.1. GEM-Hydro achieves satisfactory simulations of various hydrologic variables when compared to reference datasets. This dataset can be used for example to drive any routing model, compute climatologies or statistics for different hydrologic variables and study their variability as a function of the local geo-morphology, etc.

Gross primary productivity is more sensitive to accelerated flash droughts,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02013-w,2025-01-17,Flash droughts, characterized by their rapid onset, substantially affect terrestrial ecosystems. However, the sensitivity of ecosystem productivity to the rapid development of flash droughts under varying vegetation conditions remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the ecosystem response to the speed of flash drought onset for different plant functional types, considering the decline rate of root-zone soil moisture and standardized gross primary productivity anomaly. Our findings reveal a significant increase of approximately 10% in the proportion of 1- and 2-pentad (5 and 10 days) onset flash droughts leading to negative standardized gross primary productivity anomalies during 2001–2018. Furthermore, while standardized gross primary productivity anomalies decline at higher rates, they do not promptly respond on a shorter timescale to faster-onset flash droughts compared to slower-onset flash droughts. Vegetation types with shallower root systems exhibit higher sensitivities to faster-onset flash droughts, suggesting an escalating threat to terrestrial ecosystems in a changing climate.

Counteracting greenhouse gas and aerosol influences intensify global water seasonality over the past century,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02025-6,2025-01-18,Variations in water availability seasonality significantly impact society and ecosystems. While many studies have focused on mean or extreme precipitation, the response of water availability seasonality, influencing yearly water distribution beyond individual extremes, to human-induced climate change remains underexplored. Here we examine global and regional water availability seasonality changes from 1915 to 2014, quantifying how anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols have influenced these variations using reanalysis and simulations from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. Despite large spatiotemporal uncertainties due to regional variability and model assumptions, we find that greenhouse gases significantly amplify the seasonality, while aerosols reduce it. Given that the positive effects of greenhouse gases surpass the aerosols’ negative effects, the counterbalancing influences have led to an overall enhancement in seasonality of water availability over the past century. This trend is expected to continue in the future as greenhouse gases-induced warming continues to rise and aerosol levels decline.

The first geospatial dataset of irrigated fields (2020–2024) in Vojvodina (Serbia),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04443-9,2025-01-18,Irrigation is a cornerstone of global food security, enabling sustainable agricultural production and helping to ensure that food is available for people around the world, now and in the future. Mapping irrigated fields provides valuable information for sustainable water management, agricultural development, and environmental conservation efforts. However, the collection of high-quality training data, which is necessary for accurate irrigation mapping remains costly and labour-intensive. To address this, we created a georeferenced regional dataset consisting of location, crop type, and occurrence of the irrigation equipment which are essential information for mapping irrigated fields. Four main irrigated crops were considered: maize, soybean, sugar beet, and wheat. The dataset, consisting of a total of 1256 parcels, is created for Vojvodina, the main agricultural area in Serbia, spanning the period of five years (2020–2024). This study’s goal is to give accessibility to our dataset which further can be explored and used for building or fine-tuning machine learning and deep learning models for the automatic detection of irrigated fields using satellite imagery.

Multifaceted changes in water availability with a warmer climate,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00913-4,2025-01-24,Climate warming alters spatial and seasonal patterns of surface water availability (P-E), affecting runoff and terrestrial water storage. However, a comprehensive assessment of these changes across various hydroclimates remains lacking. We develop a multi-model ensemble approach to classify global terrestrial hydroclimate into four distinct regimes based on the mean and seasonality of P-E. P-E is projected to become increasingly variable across space and time. Wet regions with low and high seasonality are likely to experience more concentrated increases in wet-season runoff by up to 20%, highlighting potential increases in flood-related vulnerability. Low-seasonality regions exhibit faster wet-season increases and more rapid dry-season decreases in soil moisture, heightening the likelihood of water scarcity and drought. Conversely, dry regions with high seasonality are less sensitive to climate change. These findings underscore the multifaceted impacts of climate change on global water resources, necessitating the need for tailored adaptation strategies for different hydroclimate regimes.

The first geospatial dataset of irrigated fields (2020–2024) in Vojvodina (Serbia),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04443-9,2025-01-18,Irrigation is a cornerstone of global food security, enabling sustainable agricultural production and helping to ensure that food is available for people around the world, now and in the future. Mapping irrigated fields provides valuable information for sustainable water management, agricultural development, and environmental conservation efforts. However, the collection of high-quality training data, which is necessary for accurate irrigation mapping remains costly and labour-intensive. To address this, we created a georeferenced regional dataset consisting of location, crop type, and occurrence of the irrigation equipment which are essential information for mapping irrigated fields. Four main irrigated crops were considered: maize, soybean, sugar beet, and wheat. The dataset, consisting of a total of 1256 parcels, is created for Vojvodina, the main agricultural area in Serbia, spanning the period of five years (2020–2024). This study’s goal is to give accessibility to our dataset which further can be explored and used for building or fine-tuning machine learning and deep learning models for the automatic detection of irrigated fields using satellite imagery.

Flood modeling prior to the instrumental era reveals limited magnitude of 1931 Yangtze flood,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00908-1,2025-01-19,The global flood risk urges an improved understanding of flood magnitude and its mechanism, which needs insights from pre-instrumental flood investigations. Due to data scarcity, reconstructing pre-instrumental flood magnitudes relies on statistical downscaling, failing to capture nonlinear and dynamic characteristics. We developed a dynamical approach, NorESM-WRF-SWAT, integrating a global climate, a regional, and a hydrologic model to investigate the 1931 Yangtze River flood (the deadliest in the world) and compared it with the 1998’s. Through validation, our method outperforms the statistical method in simulating precipitations and river discharges. For the first time, we presented detailed insights into the intensity and duration of the 1931 flood, revealing a smaller magnitude but associated with an amplified loss, likely due to social vulnerability and reduced societal resilience compared to the 1998’s. While successful simulation can be interfered with by model variability, our dynamical method shows promise for simulating pre-instrumental flood and building a long-term pre-instrumental-hydrology database.

Emergent constraints on global soil moisture projections under climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02024-7,2025-01-20,Surface soil moisture is projected to decrease under global warming. Such projections are mostly based on climate models, which show large uncertainty (i.e., inter-model spread) partly due to inadequate observational constraint. Here we identify strong physically-based emergent relationships between soil moisture change (2070–2099 minus 1980–2014) and recent air temperature and precipitation trends across an ensemble of climate models. We extend the commonly used univariate Emergent Constraints to a bivariate method and use observed temperature and precipitation trends to constrain global soil moisture changes. Our results show that the bivariate emergent constraints can reduce soil moisture change uncertainty by 7.87%, which is four times more effective than traditional temperature-based univariate constraints. The bivariate emergent constraints change the sign of soil moisture change from negative to positive for semi-arid, dry sub-humid and humid regions and global land as a whole, but exacerbates the drying trend in arid and hyper-arid regions.

Increasing certainty in projected local extreme precipitation change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56235-9,2025-01-20,The latest climate models project widely varying magnitudes of future extreme precipitation changes, thus impeding effective adaptation planning. Many observational constraints have been proposed to reduce the uncertainty of these projections at global to sub-continental scales, but adaptation generally requires detailed, local scale information. Here, we present a temperature-based adaptative emergent constraint strategy combined with data aggregation that reduces the error variance of projected end-of-century changes in annual extremes of daily precipitation under a high emissions scenario by &gt;20% across most areas of the world. These improved projections could benefit nearly 90% of the world’s population by permitting better impact assessment and adaptation planning at local levels. Our physically motivated strategy, which considers the thermodynamic and dynamic components of projected extreme precipitation change, exploits the link between global warming and the thermodynamic component of extreme precipitation. Rigorous cross-validation provides strong evidence of its reliability in constraining local extreme precipitation projections.

Dichotomy retreat and aqueous alteration on Noachian Mars recorded in highland remnants,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01634-8,2025-01-20,The Mawrth Vallis region is a plateau situated on the highland side of Mars’ hemispheric dichotomy boundary. It has a &gt;200-m-thick phyllosilicate-bearing stratigraphic succession that indicates extensive aqueous alteration between 4.1 Ga and 3.7 Ga, during the Noachian Period. In addition, thousands of kilometre-scale isolated mounds in the lowlands north and west of Mawrth Vallis have been identified. Here we use geomorphological and spectroscopic analyses to show that the mounds are erosional remnants that formed through retreat of the highland plateau in the Noachian. Consequently, the escarpment that marks the surface expression of the dichotomy must have receded south-southeast by hundreds of kilometres in this area. Lateral and stratigraphic geochemical variation in the mounds show that widespread, multiphase aqueous alteration occurred in situ across this region in surface and subsurface environments. The mound succession is underlain by a pyroxene-rich unit that represents unaltered material below the regional phyllosilicate-bearing sequence and is unconformably overlain by a thin capping unit that marks the end of large-scale regional aqueous activity. Thus, the mounds contain a stratigraphic record of the onset, evolution and cessation of Noachian aqueous conditions in this region, detailing the environment and climate of Mars at its most habitable.

Projected runoff declines from plant physiological effects on precipitation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00361-z,2025-01-20,The impact of plants on runoff under high atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is a major uncertainty for future water resources. Theory and Earth system models (ESMs) suggest that stricter plant stomatal regulation under high CO<sub>2</sub> will reduce transpiration, potentially boosting runoff. Yet, across a 12-member ensemble of idealized ESM simulations that isolate plant responses to CO<sub>2</sub>, we show that lower transpiration robustly enhances runoff over only 5% of modelled global land area. Precipitation changes are five times more important than transpiration changes in driving runoff responses and are a significant signal of CO<sub>2</sub> physiological forcing over 31–57% of land areas across models. Crucially, ESMs largely disagree on where physiologically forced precipitation changes occur but agree that plant responses in most locations are as likely to reduce runoff as increase it. These results imply that large model uncertainties in precipitation responses, rather than transpiration responses, explain why ESMs disagree on plant physiologically driven runoff changes.

Measurements of groundwater, hydrodynamics, and sand characteristics at a dissipative sea turtle nesting beach,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04455-5,2025-01-21,Beach groundwater and nearshore hydrodynamic data were collected during a field experiment along two dissipative beach transects on Galveston Island, Texas, in the fall of 2023. The monitored beaches serve as nesting habitat for the critically endangered Kemp’s ridley sea turtle. Conditions ranged from calm to stormy, with two storms occurring during the experiment, inundating the entire beach up to the dune toe. Collected hydrodynamic data include readings from pressure loggers submerged in the foreshore and mounted in groundwater wells in the backshore, data from two wave buoys about 1.5 km offshore, and GoPro timestacks of the instantaneous waterline (wave runup). Other collected data include bathymetry and topography surveys, subsurface temperature and moisture content readings, and sediment characteristics. This comprehensive dataset can be used to (1) study relevant beach inundation and groundwater processes, including their effect on the local ecosystem (e.g., repeated flooding of sea turtle nests), (2) study the propagation of nearshore hydrodynamic processes into the beach matrix and groundwater table, and (3) validate existing beach groundwater models.

The dataset covers the basins of the Laurentian Great Lakes and the Ottawa River and extends over the period 2001–2018. The data consist of all variables (hourly fluxes and state variables) related to the water balance of GEM-Hydro’s land-surface scheme (including precipitation, surface and sub-surface runoff, drainage, evaporation, snow water equivalent, soil moisture…) and mean daily streamflow at 212 gauge locations. These outputs were simulated with a calibrated version of the GEM-Hydro model that was run in open-loop mode (no assimilation) and driven with atmospheric forcings coming from ECCC’s Canadian Surface Reanalysis version 2.1.

Multifaceted changes in water availability with a warmer climate,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00913-4,2025-01-24,Climate warming alters spatial and seasonal patterns of surface water availability (P-E), affecting runoff and terrestrial water storage. However, a comprehensive assessment of these changes across various hydroclimates remains lacking. We develop a multi-model ensemble approach to classify global terrestrial hydroclimate into four distinct regimes based on the mean and seasonality of P-E. P-E is projected to become increasingly variable across space and time. Wet regions with low and high seasonality are likely to experience more concentrated increases in wet-season runoff by up to 20%, highlighting potential increases in flood-related vulnerability. Low-seasonality regions exhibit faster wet-season increases and more rapid dry-season decreases in soil moisture, heightening the likelihood of water scarcity and drought. Conversely, dry regions with high seasonality are less sensitive to climate change. These findings underscore the multifaceted impacts of climate change on global water resources, necessitating the need for tailored adaptation strategies for different hydroclimate regimes.

However, temporal gaps within these datasets and the lack of TWSA observations prior to 2002 limit our understanding of long-term freshwater variability. In this study, we develop GR<i>Ai</i>CE, a set of four global monthly TWSA reconstructions from 1984 to 2021 at 0.5° spatial resolution, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) neural networks.

Shifted dominant flood drivers of an alpine glacierized catchment in the Tianshan region revealed through interpretable deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00918-z,2025-01-26,The Kumalak River, a typical alpine glacierized catchment in the Tianshan region, experiences complex flooding driven by glacier meltwater, snowmelt, and rainfall. However, the mechanisms driving these processes under climate change remain unclear. To address this, a SWAT-Glacier hydrological model and a degree–day factor model were used for snowmelt, glacier meltwater, and rainfall calculations. Two Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models (LSTM-SG and LSTM-DDF) were developed using these inputs, and additive decomposition and integrated gradient methods were applied to interpret flood mechanisms. Glacier meltwater was found to dominate annual maximum flood (AMF) events, while snowmelt drove annual spring maximum flood (AMFSp) events. For AMF events (1960–2018), contributions were 10.01–12.21% from snowmelt, 60.49–60.92% from glacier meltwater, and 26.86–29.50% from rainfall. For AMFSp events (1961–2018), contributions were 48.49–56.08% from snowmelt, 16.12–22.08% from glacier meltwater, and 27.79–29.42% from rainfall. These findings provide critical insights for enhancing flood prediction and optimizing water resource management.

Impacts of irrigation expansion on moist-heat stress based on IRRMIP results,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56356-1,2025-01-26,Irrigation rapidly expanded during the 20<sup><i>t</i><i>h</i></sup> century, affecting climate via water, energy, and biogeochemical changes. Previous assessments of these effects predominantly relied on a single Earth System Model, and therefore suffered from structural model uncertainties. Here we quantify the impacts of historical irrigation expansion on climate by analysing simulation results from six Earth system models participating in the Irrigation Model Intercomparison Project (IRRMIP). Results show that irrigation expansion causes a rapid increase in irrigation water withdrawal, which leads to less frequent 2-meter air temperature heat extremes across heavily irrigated areas (≥4 times less likely). However, due to the irrigation-induced increase in air humidity, the cooling effect of irrigation expansion on moist-heat stress is less pronounced or even reversed, depending on the heat stress metric. In summary, this study indicates that irrigation deployment is not an efficient adaptation measure to escalating human heat stress under climate change, calling for carefully dealing with the increased exposure of local people to moist-heat stress.

For AMF events (1960–2018), contributions were 10.01–12.21% from snowmelt, 60.49–60.92% from glacier meltwater, and 26.86–29.50% from rainfall. For AMFSp events (1961–2018), contributions were 48.49–56.08% from snowmelt, 16.12–22.08% from glacier meltwater, and 27.79–29.42% from rainfall. These findings provide critical insights for enhancing flood prediction and optimizing water resource management.

Impacts of irrigation expansion on moist-heat stress based on IRRMIP results,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56356-1,2025-01-26,Irrigation rapidly expanded during the 20<sup><i>t</i><i>h</i></sup> century, affecting climate via water, energy, and biogeochemical changes. Previous assessments of these effects predominantly relied on a single Earth System Model, and therefore suffered from structural model uncertainties. Here we quantify the impacts of historical irrigation expansion on climate by analysing simulation results from six Earth system models participating in the Irrigation Model Intercomparison Project (IRRMIP). Results show that irrigation expansion causes a rapid increase in irrigation water withdrawal, which leads to less frequent 2-meter air temperature heat extremes across heavily irrigated areas (≥4 times less likely). However, due to the irrigation-induced increase in air humidity, the cooling effect of irrigation expansion on moist-heat stress is less pronounced or even reversed, depending on the heat stress metric. In summary, this study indicates that irrigation deployment is not an efficient adaptation measure to escalating human heat stress under climate change, calling for carefully dealing with the increased exposure of local people to moist-heat stress.

Increasing certainty in projected local extreme precipitation change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56235-9,2025-01-20,The latest climate models project widely varying magnitudes of future extreme precipitation changes, thus impeding effective adaptation planning. Many observational constraints have been proposed to reduce the uncertainty of these projections at global to sub-continental scales, but adaptation generally requires detailed, local scale information. Here, we present a temperature-based adaptative emergent constraint strategy combined with data aggregation that reduces the error variance of projected end-of-century changes in annual extremes of daily precipitation under a high emissions scenario by &gt;20% across most areas of the world. These improved projections could benefit nearly 90% of the world’s population by permitting better impact assessment and adaptation planning at local levels. Our physically motivated strategy, which considers the thermodynamic and dynamic components of projected extreme precipitation change, exploits the link between global warming and the thermodynamic component of extreme precipitation. Rigorous cross-validation provides strong evidence of its reliability in constraining local extreme precipitation projections.

Dichotomy retreat and aqueous alteration on Noachian Mars recorded in highland remnants,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01634-8,2025-01-20,The Mawrth Vallis region is a plateau situated on the highland side of Mars’ hemispheric dichotomy boundary. It has a &gt;200-m-thick phyllosilicate-bearing stratigraphic succession that indicates extensive aqueous alteration between 4.1 Ga and 3.7 Ga, during the Noachian Period. In addition, thousands of kilometre-scale isolated mounds in the lowlands north and west of Mawrth Vallis have been identified. Here we use geomorphological and spectroscopic analyses to show that the mounds are erosional remnants that formed through retreat of the highland plateau in the Noachian. Consequently, the escarpment that marks the surface expression of the dichotomy must have receded south-southeast by hundreds of kilometres in this area. Lateral and stratigraphic geochemical variation in the mounds show that widespread, multiphase aqueous alteration occurred in situ across this region in surface and subsurface environments. The mound succession is underlain by a pyroxene-rich unit that represents unaltered material below the regional phyllosilicate-bearing sequence and is unconformably overlain by a thin capping unit that marks the end of large-scale regional aqueous activity. Thus, the mounds contain a stratigraphic record of the onset, evolution and cessation of Noachian aqueous conditions in this region, detailing the environment and climate of Mars at its most habitable.

Projected runoff declines from plant physiological effects on precipitation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00361-z,2025-01-20,The impact of plants on runoff under high atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is a major uncertainty for future water resources. Theory and Earth system models (ESMs) suggest that stricter plant stomatal regulation under high CO<sub>2</sub> will reduce transpiration, potentially boosting runoff. Yet, across a 12-member ensemble of idealized ESM simulations that isolate plant responses to CO<sub>2</sub>, we show that lower transpiration robustly enhances runoff over only 5% of modelled global land area. Precipitation changes are five times more important than transpiration changes in driving runoff responses and are a significant signal of CO<sub>2</sub> physiological forcing over 31–57% of land areas across models. Crucially, ESMs largely disagree on where physiologically forced precipitation changes occur but agree that plant responses in most locations are as likely to reduce runoff as increase it. These results imply that large model uncertainties in precipitation responses, rather than transpiration responses, explain why ESMs disagree on plant physiologically driven runoff changes.

Measurements of groundwater, hydrodynamics, and sand characteristics at a dissipative sea turtle nesting beach,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04455-5,2025-01-21,Beach groundwater and nearshore hydrodynamic data were collected during a field experiment along two dissipative beach transects on Galveston Island, Texas, in the fall of 2023. The monitored beaches serve as nesting habitat for the critically endangered Kemp’s ridley sea turtle. Conditions ranged from calm to stormy, with two storms occurring during the experiment, inundating the entire beach up to the dune toe. Collected hydrodynamic data include readings from pressure loggers submerged in the foreshore and mounted in groundwater wells in the backshore, data from two wave buoys about 1.5 km offshore, and GoPro timestacks of the instantaneous waterline (wave runup). Other collected data include bathymetry and topography surveys, subsurface temperature and moisture content readings, and sediment characteristics. This comprehensive dataset can be used to (1) study relevant beach inundation and groundwater processes, including their effect on the local ecosystem (e.g., repeated flooding of sea turtle nests), (2) study the propagation of nearshore hydrodynamic processes into the beach matrix and groundwater table, and (3) validate existing beach groundwater models.

The dataset covers the basins of the Laurentian Great Lakes and the Ottawa River and extends over the period 2001–2018. The data consist of all variables (hourly fluxes and state variables) related to the water balance of GEM-Hydro’s land-surface scheme (including precipitation, surface and sub-surface runoff, drainage, evaporation, snow water equivalent, soil moisture…) and mean daily streamflow at 212 gauge locations. These outputs were simulated with a calibrated version of the GEM-Hydro model that was run in open-loop mode (no assimilation) and driven with atmospheric forcings coming from ECCC’s Canadian Surface Reanalysis version 2.1. GEM-Hydro achieves satisfactory simulations of various hydrologic variables when compared to reference datasets. This dataset can be used for example to drive any routing model, compute climatologies or statistics for different hydrologic variables and study their variability as a function of the local geo-morphology, etc.

Multifaceted changes in water availability with a warmer climate,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00913-4,2025-01-24,Climate warming alters spatial and seasonal patterns of surface water availability (P-E), affecting runoff and terrestrial water storage. However, a comprehensive assessment of these changes across various hydroclimates remains lacking. We develop a multi-model ensemble approach to classify global terrestrial hydroclimate into four distinct regimes based on the mean and seasonality of P-E. P-E is projected to become increasingly variable across space and time. Wet regions with low and high seasonality are likely to experience more concentrated increases in wet-season runoff by up to 20%, highlighting potential increases in flood-related vulnerability. Low-seasonality regions exhibit faster wet-season increases and more rapid dry-season decreases in soil moisture, heightening the likelihood of water scarcity and drought. Conversely, dry regions with high seasonality are less sensitive to climate change. These findings underscore the multifaceted impacts of climate change on global water resources, necessitating the need for tailored adaptation strategies for different hydroclimate regimes.

GRAiCE: reconstructing terrestrial water storage anomalies with recurrent neural networks,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04403-3,2025-01-25,The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on (GRACE-FO) missions have provided estimates of Terrestrial Water Storage Anomalies (TWSA) since 2002, enabling the monitoring of global hydrological changes. However, temporal gaps within these datasets and the lack of TWSA observations prior to 2002 limit our understanding of long-term freshwater variability. In this study, we develop GR<i>Ai</i>CE, a set of four global monthly TWSA reconstructions from 1984 to 2021 at 0.5° spatial resolution, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) neural networks. Our models accurately reproduce GRACE/GRACE-FO observations at the global scale and effectively capture the impacts of climate extremes. Overall, GR<i>Ai</i>CE outperforms a previous reference TWSA reconstruction in predicting observed TWSA and provides reliable water budget estimates at the river basin scale. By generating long-term continuous TWSA time series, GR<i>Ai</i>CE will offer valuable insights into the impacts of climate variability and change on freshwater resources.

Shifted dominant flood drivers of an alpine glacierized catchment in the Tianshan region revealed through interpretable deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00918-z,2025-01-26,The Kumalak River, a typical alpine glacierized catchment in the Tianshan region, experiences complex flooding driven by glacier meltwater, snowmelt, and rainfall. However, the mechanisms driving these processes under climate change remain unclear.

Our findings deepen perception into the complex interactions between precipitation, land surface processes, and climate change, offering valuable implications for future water resource management and hydrological modeling.

Chronic nitrogen legacy in the aquifers of China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02016-7,2025-01-28,About half of the global drinking water comes from groundwater, yet groundwater quality is threatened by high nitrate concentrations globally. Our understanding of groundwater nitrate concentrations is often limited by inaccessibility of groundwater and scarcity of nitrate data in groundwater. Here we used machine learning and decision tree-heatmap analysis by compiling nitrate concentrations and isotope data from 4047 groundwater sites across China to understand their dynamics and drivers across gradients of geographical, climate, and human factors. Results show that nitrate concentrations vary substantially over depth and are generally lower in deeper groundwater, indicating potentially higher nitrate removal rates according to nitrate isotopic pattern such as denitrification at depth. At similar groundwater aquifer depths, nitrate concentrations are highest in urban regions with high population density. In addition, nitrate concentrations are generally higher in arid northern China than humid southern China. Interestingly, while groundwater nitrate concentrations are lower at deeper depths, slow groundwater flow also indicates prolonged nitrogen legacy. Although there has been an overall decline in groundwater nitrogen pollution in China since 2016, persistent pollution has lingered. Future strategies for groundwater quality protection in China should address the long-term legacy of nitrate in different aquifers and rising nitrogen levels in groundwater.

Here we address this by introducing a quantitative metric, average daily fraction of precipitation transformed into terrestrial water storage, providing an important advancement into the dynamics of water storage by utilizing the enhanced terrestrial water storage statistical reconstruction method and water storage data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites and their follow-on mission. This study reveals that approximately 64% of land precipitation contributes to terrestrial water storage in global 121 river basins from 2002 to 2021, with evident variations observed across different climatic and geographical regions. Our findings deepen perception into the complex interactions between precipitation, land surface processes, and climate change, offering valuable implications for future water resource management and hydrological modeling.

Chronic nitrogen legacy in the aquifers of China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02016-7,2025-01-28,About half of the global drinking water comes from groundwater, yet groundwater quality is threatened by high nitrate concentrations globally. Our understanding of groundwater nitrate concentrations is often limited by inaccessibility of groundwater and scarcity of nitrate data in groundwater. Here we used machine learning and decision tree-heatmap analysis by compiling nitrate concentrations and isotope data from 4047 groundwater sites across China to understand their dynamics and drivers across gradients of geographical, climate, and human factors. Results show that nitrate concentrations vary substantially over depth and are generally lower in deeper groundwater, indicating potentially higher nitrate removal rates according to nitrate isotopic pattern such as denitrification at depth. At similar groundwater aquifer depths, nitrate concentrations are highest in urban regions with high population density. In addition, nitrate concentrations are generally higher in arid northern China than humid southern China. Interestingly, while groundwater nitrate concentrations are lower at deeper depths, slow groundwater flow also indicates prolonged nitrogen legacy. Although there has been an overall decline in groundwater nitrogen pollution in China since 2016, persistent pollution has lingered. Future strategies for groundwater quality protection in China should address the long-term legacy of nitrate in different aquifers and rising nitrogen levels in groundwater.

Australian water quality trends over two decades show deterioration in the Great Barrier Reef region and recovery in the Murray-Darling Basin,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02044-3,2025-01-29,Understanding river water quality trajectories and drivers is crucial for effective environmental management. Here we present a comprehensive nation-wide water quality trend assessment across Australia with 287 catchments from 2000 to 2019. About half of the catchments show significant trends in the flow-normalised concentration for each parameter analysed. Most of these significant trends are due to changes in concentration-flow relationships rather than long-term trends in flow. Two of Australia’s major river basins show opposing regional patterns in their significant trends. The North East Coast, which largely flows into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, has increasing phosphorus and sediments. This potentially reflects lagged effects of increasing land clearing and fertilisation since 1960s, while land improvement in the region has not yet demonstrated improvement on water quality. The Murray-Darling Basin has decreasing salinity, phosphorus, and sediment, likely driven by effects of a region-scale salinity management interventions and a prolonged drought on catchment processes.

Human-induced water loss potentially threatens sustainable development of sandy regions in China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02046-1,2025-01-30,Water is indispensable for sustainable socioeconomic development, especially in China’s sandy regions. Despite existing studies in sandy regions, the drivers of changes in total water storage and their potential impacts remain inadequately understood. Here we found a 55.97 billion m³ net loss in total water storage from 2002 to 2023 by integrating multiple datasets. Water loss was primarily attributed to increased farmland irrigation (49.56 billion m³) and ecological restoration (37.04 billion m³). In the coming 40 years, water supply capacity will decrease by up to 6.54% and 19.07% under low and high emission scenarios, respectively, requiring reductions in human water consumption of 60% to 135%. This depletion potentially threatens both regional sustainability and national ecological security. This study calls for urgent scientific regulations on water resources, including strict control of local consumption and enhancement of supply capacity.

Global water gaps under future warming levels,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56517-2,2025-01-30,Understanding the impacts of climate change on water resources is crucial for developing effective adaptation strategies. We quantify “water gaps”, or unsustainable water use – the shortfall where water demand exceeds supply, resulting in scarcity. We quantify baseline and future water gaps using a multi-model analysis that incorporates two plausible future warming scenarios. The baseline global water gap stands at 457.9 km<sup>3</sup>/yr, with projections indicating an increase of 26.5 km<sup>3</sup>/yr (+5.8%) and 67.4 km<sup>3</sup>/yr (+14.7%) under 1.5 °C and 3 °C warming scenarios, respectively. These projections highlight the uneven impact of warming levels on water gaps, emphasizing the need for continued climate change mitigation to alleviate stress on water resources. Our results also underscore the unequal adaptation needs across countries and basins, influenced by varying warming scenarios, with important regional differences and model variability complicating future projections. Robust water management strategies are needed to tackle the escalating water scarcity caused by global warming.

Hydrologic outputs generated over the Great Lakes with a calibrated version of the GEM-Hydro model,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04409-x,2025-01-22,This dataset contains outputs from a calibrated version of the GEM-Hydro model developed at Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and is available on the Federated Research Data Repository. The dataset covers the basins of the Laurentian Great Lakes and the Ottawa River and extends over the period 2001–2018. The data consist of all variables (hourly fluxes and state variables) related to the water balance of GEM-Hydro’s land-surface scheme (including precipitation, surface and sub-surface runoff, drainage, evaporation, snow water equivalent, soil moisture…) and mean daily streamflow at 212 gauge locations. These outputs were simulated with a calibrated version of the GEM-Hydro model that was run in open-loop mode (no assimilation) and driven with atmospheric forcings coming from ECCC’s Canadian Surface Reanalysis version 2.1. GEM-Hydro achieves satisfactory simulations of various hydrologic variables when compared to reference datasets. This dataset can be used for example to drive any routing model, compute climatologies or statistics for different hydrologic variables and study their variability as a function of the local geo-morphology, etc.

Multifaceted changes in water availability with a warmer climate,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00913-4,2025-01-24,Climate warming alters spatial and seasonal patterns of surface water availability (P-E), affecting runoff and terrestrial water storage. However, a comprehensive assessment of these changes across various hydroclimates remains lacking. We develop a multi-model ensemble approach to classify global terrestrial hydroclimate into four distinct regimes based on the mean and seasonality of P-E. P-E is projected to become increasingly variable across space and time. Wet regions with low and high seasonality are likely to experience more concentrated increases in wet-season runoff by up to 20%, highlighting potential increases in flood-related vulnerability. Low-seasonality regions exhibit faster wet-season increases and more rapid dry-season decreases in soil moisture, heightening the likelihood of water scarcity and drought. Conversely, dry regions with high seasonality are less sensitive to climate change. These findings underscore the multifaceted impacts of climate change on global water resources, necessitating the need for tailored adaptation strategies for different hydroclimate regimes.

GRAiCE: reconstructing terrestrial water storage anomalies with recurrent neural networks,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04403-3,2025-01-25,The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on (GRACE-FO) missions have provided estimates of Terrestrial Water Storage Anomalies (TWSA) since 2002, enabling the monitoring of global hydrological changes. However, temporal gaps within these datasets and the lack of TWSA observations prior to 2002 limit our understanding of long-term freshwater variability. In this study, we develop GR<i>Ai</i>CE, a set of four global monthly TWSA reconstructions from 1984 to 2021 at 0.5° spatial resolution, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) neural networks. Our models accurately reproduce GRACE/GRACE-FO observations at the global scale and effectively capture the impacts of climate extremes. Overall, GR<i>Ai</i>CE outperforms a previous reference TWSA reconstruction in predicting observed TWSA and provides reliable water budget estimates at the river basin scale. By generating long-term continuous TWSA time series, GR<i>Ai</i>CE will offer valuable insights into the impacts of climate variability and change on freshwater resources.

Shifted dominant flood drivers of an alpine glacierized catchment in the Tianshan region revealed through interpretable deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00918-z,2025-01-26,The Kumalak River, a typical alpine glacierized catchment in the Tianshan region, experiences complex flooding driven by glacier meltwater, snowmelt, and rainfall. However, the mechanisms driving these processes under climate change remain unclear. To address this, a SWAT-Glacier hydrological model and a degree–day factor model were used for snowmelt, glacier meltwater, and rainfall calculations. Two Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models (LSTM-SG and LSTM-DDF) were developed using these inputs, and additive decomposition and integrated gradient methods were applied to interpret flood mechanisms. Glacier meltwater was found to dominate annual maximum flood (AMF) events, while snowmelt drove annual spring maximum flood (AMFSp) events. For AMF events (1960–2018), contributions were 10.01–12.21% from snowmelt, 60.49–60.92% from glacier meltwater, and 26.86–29.50% from rainfall. For AMFSp events (1961–2018), contributions were 48.49–56.08% from snowmelt, 16.12–22.08% from glacier meltwater, and 27.79–29.42% from rainfall. These findings provide critical insights for enhancing flood prediction and optimizing water resource management.

Impacts of irrigation expansion on moist-heat stress based on IRRMIP results,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56356-1,2025-01-26,Irrigation rapidly expanded during the 20<sup><i>t</i><i>h</i></sup> century, affecting climate via water, energy, and biogeochemical changes. Previous assessments of these effects predominantly relied on a single Earth System Model, and therefore suffered from structural model uncertainties. Here we quantify the impacts of historical irrigation expansion on climate by analysing simulation results from six Earth system models participating in the Irrigation Model Intercomparison Project (IRRMIP). Results show that irrigation expansion causes a rapid increase in irrigation water withdrawal, which leads to less frequent 2-meter air temperature heat extremes across heavily irrigated areas (≥4 times less likely). However, due to the irrigation-induced increase in air humidity, the cooling effect of irrigation expansion on moist-heat stress is less pronounced or even reversed, depending on the heat stress metric. In summary, this study indicates that irrigation deployment is not an efficient adaptation measure to escalating human heat stress under climate change, calling for carefully dealing with the increased exposure of local people to moist-heat stress.

For AMFSp events (1961–2018), contributions were 48.49–56.08% from snowmelt, 16.12–22.08% from glacier meltwater, and 27.79–29.42% from rainfall. These findings provide critical insights for enhancing flood prediction and optimizing water resource management.

Impacts of irrigation expansion on moist-heat stress based on IRRMIP results,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56356-1,2025-01-26,Irrigation rapidly expanded during the 20<sup><i>t</i><i>h</i></sup> century, affecting climate via water, energy, and biogeochemical changes. Previous assessments of these effects predominantly relied on a single Earth System Model, and therefore suffered from structural model uncertainties. Here we quantify the impacts of historical irrigation expansion on climate by analysing simulation results from six Earth system models participating in the Irrigation Model Intercomparison Project (IRRMIP). Results show that irrigation expansion causes a rapid increase in irrigation water withdrawal, which leads to less frequent 2-meter air temperature heat extremes across heavily irrigated areas (≥4 times less likely). However, due to the irrigation-induced increase in air humidity, the cooling effect of irrigation expansion on moist-heat stress is less pronounced or even reversed, depending on the heat stress metric. In summary, this study indicates that irrigation deployment is not an efficient adaptation measure to escalating human heat stress under climate change, calling for carefully dealing with the increased exposure of local people to moist-heat stress.

Over 60% precipitation transformed into terrestrial water storage in global river basins from 2002 to 2021,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01967-7,2025-01-27,The crucial role of precipitation as a primary driver for terrestrial water cycle is well-established. However, quantifying the transformation of daily precipitation into terrestrial water storage remains a challenge. Here we address this by introducing a quantitative metric, average daily fraction of precipitation transformed into terrestrial water storage, providing an important advancement into the dynamics of water storage by utilizing the enhanced terrestrial water storage statistical reconstruction method and water storage data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites and their follow-on mission. This study reveals that approximately 64% of land precipitation contributes to terrestrial water storage in global 121 river basins from 2002 to 2021, with evident variations observed across different climatic and geographical regions. Our findings deepen perception into the complex interactions between precipitation, land surface processes, and climate change, offering valuable implications for future water resource management and hydrological modeling.

Chronic nitrogen legacy in the aquifers of China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02016-7,2025-01-28,About half of the global drinking water comes from groundwater, yet groundwater quality is threatened by high nitrate concentrations globally. Our understanding of groundwater nitrate concentrations is often limited by inaccessibility of groundwater and scarcity of nitrate data in groundwater. Here we used machine learning and decision tree-heatmap analysis by compiling nitrate concentrations and isotope data from 4047 groundwater sites across China to understand their dynamics and drivers across gradients of geographical, climate, and human factors. Results show that nitrate concentrations vary substantially over depth and are generally lower in deeper groundwater, indicating potentially higher nitrate removal rates according to nitrate isotopic pattern such as denitrification at depth. At similar groundwater aquifer depths, nitrate concentrations are highest in urban regions with high population density. In addition, nitrate concentrations are generally higher in arid northern China than humid southern China. Interestingly, while groundwater nitrate concentrations are lower at deeper depths, slow groundwater flow also indicates prolonged nitrogen legacy. Although there has been an overall decline in groundwater nitrogen pollution in China since 2016, persistent pollution has lingered. Future strategies for groundwater quality protection in China should address the long-term legacy of nitrate in different aquifers and rising nitrogen levels in groundwater.

Australian water quality trends over two decades show deterioration in the Great Barrier Reef region and recovery in the Murray-Darling Basin,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02044-3,2025-01-29,Understanding river water quality trajectories and drivers is crucial for effective environmental management. Here we present a comprehensive nation-wide water quality trend assessment across Australia with 287 catchments from 2000 to 2019. About half of the catchments show significant trends in the flow-normalised concentration for each parameter analysed. Most of these significant trends are due to changes in concentration-flow relationships rather than long-term trends in flow. Two of Australia’s major river basins show opposing regional patterns in their significant trends. The North East Coast, which largely flows into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, has increasing phosphorus and sediments. This potentially reflects lagged effects of increasing land clearing and fertilisation since 1960s, while land improvement in the region has not yet demonstrated improvement on water quality. The Murray-Darling Basin has decreasing salinity, phosphorus, and sediment, likely driven by effects of a region-scale salinity management interventions and a prolonged drought on catchment processes.

Human-induced water loss potentially threatens sustainable development of sandy regions in China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02046-1,2025-01-30,Water is indispensable for sustainable socioeconomic development, especially in China’s sandy regions. Despite existing studies in sandy regions, the drivers of changes in total water storage and their potential impacts remain inadequately understood. Here we found a 55.97 billion m³ net loss in total water storage from 2002 to 2023 by integrating multiple datasets. Water loss was primarily attributed to increased farmland irrigation (49.56 billion m³) and ecological restoration (37.04 billion m³). In the coming 40 years, water supply capacity will decrease by up to 6.54% and 19.07% under low and high emission scenarios, respectively, requiring reductions in human water consumption of 60% to 135%. This depletion potentially threatens both regional sustainability and national ecological security. This study calls for urgent scientific regulations on water resources, including strict control of local consumption and enhancement of supply capacity.

Global water gaps under future warming levels,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56517-2,2025-01-30,Understanding the impacts of climate change on water resources is crucial for developing effective adaptation strategies. We quantify “water gaps”, or unsustainable water use – the shortfall where water demand exceeds supply, resulting in scarcity. We quantify baseline and future water gaps using a multi-model analysis that incorporates two plausible future warming scenarios. The baseline global water gap stands at 457.9 km<sup>3</sup>/yr, with projections indicating an increase of 26.5 km<sup>3</sup>/yr (+5.8%) and 67.4 km<sup>3</sup>/yr (+14.7%) under 1.5 °C and 3 °C warming scenarios, respectively. These projections highlight the uneven impact of warming levels on water gaps, emphasizing the need for continued climate change mitigation to alleviate stress on water resources. Our results also underscore the unequal adaptation needs across countries and basins, influenced by varying warming scenarios, with important regional differences and model variability complicating future projections. Robust water management strategies are needed to tackle the escalating water scarcity caused by global warming.

Bias-corrected high-resolution temperature and precipitation projections for Canada,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04396-z,2025-02-01,High-resolution precipitation and temperature projections are indispensable for informed decision-making, risk assessment, and planning. Here, we have developed an extensive database (SPQM-CMIP6-CAN) of high-resolution (0.1°) precipitation and temperature projections extending till 2100 at a daily scale for Canada. We employed a novel Semi-Parametric Quantile Mapping (SPQM) methodology to bias-correct the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase-6 (CMIP6) projections for four Shared Socio-economic Pathways. SPQM is simple, yet robust, in reproducing the observed marginal properties, trends, and variability according to future scenarios, while maintaining a smooth transition from observations to projected simulations. The SPQM-CMIP6-CAN database encompasses 693 simulations derived from 34 diverse climate models for precipitation. Similarly, for temperature projections, our database comprises 581 simulations from 27 climate models. These projections are valuable for hydrological, environmental, and ecological studies, offering a comprehensive resource for analyses within these domains. Furthermore, these projections serve as a vital tool for the quantification of uncertainties arising from climate models, their variant configurations, and future scenarios.

Multifaceted changes in water availability with a warmer climate,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00913-4,2025-01-24,Climate warming alters spatial and seasonal patterns of surface water availability (P-E), affecting runoff and terrestrial water storage. However, a comprehensive assessment of these changes across various hydroclimates remains lacking. We develop a multi-model ensemble approach to classify global terrestrial hydroclimate into four distinct regimes based on the mean and seasonality of P-E. P-E is projected to become increasingly variable across space and time. Wet regions with low and high seasonality are likely to experience more concentrated increases in wet-season runoff by up to 20%, highlighting potential increases in flood-related vulnerability. Low-seasonality regions exhibit faster wet-season increases and more rapid dry-season decreases in soil moisture, heightening the likelihood of water scarcity and drought. Conversely, dry regions with high seasonality are less sensitive to climate change. These findings underscore the multifaceted impacts of climate change on global water resources, necessitating the need for tailored adaptation strategies for different hydroclimate regimes.

GRAiCE: reconstructing terrestrial water storage anomalies with recurrent neural networks,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04403-3,2025-01-25,The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on (GRACE-FO) missions have provided estimates of Terrestrial Water Storage Anomalies (TWSA) since 2002, enabling the monitoring of global hydrological changes. However, temporal gaps within these datasets and the lack of TWSA observations prior to 2002 limit our understanding of long-term freshwater variability. In this study, we develop GR<i>Ai</i>CE, a set of four global monthly TWSA reconstructions from 1984 to 2021 at 0.5° spatial resolution, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) neural networks. Our models accurately reproduce GRACE/GRACE-FO observations at the global scale and effectively capture the impacts of climate extremes. Overall, GR<i>Ai</i>CE outperforms a previous reference TWSA reconstruction in predicting observed TWSA and provides reliable water budget estimates at the river basin scale. By generating long-term continuous TWSA time series, GR<i>Ai</i>CE will offer valuable insights into the impacts of climate variability and change on freshwater resources.

Shifted dominant flood drivers of an alpine glacierized catchment in the Tianshan region revealed through interpretable deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00918-z,2025-01-26,The Kumalak River, a typical alpine glacierized catchment in the Tianshan region, experiences complex flooding driven by glacier meltwater, snowmelt, and rainfall. However, the mechanisms driving these processes under climate change remain unclear. To address this, a SWAT-Glacier hydrological model and a degree–day factor model were used for snowmelt, glacier meltwater, and rainfall calculations. Two Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models (LSTM-SG and LSTM-DDF) were developed using these inputs, and additive decomposition and integrated gradient methods were applied to interpret flood mechanisms. Glacier meltwater was found to dominate annual maximum flood (AMF) events, while snowmelt drove annual spring maximum flood (AMFSp) events. For AMF events (1960–2018), contributions were 10.01–12.21% from snowmelt, 60.49–60.92% from glacier meltwater, and 26.86–29.50% from rainfall.

The hidden influence of terrestrial groundwater on salt marsh function and resilience,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00384-6,2025-02-03,Salt marshes are hotspots of nutrient processing and carbon sequestration. So far, studies addressing spatiotemporal variability in and drivers of salt marsh biogeochemical function, carbon storage and resilience have focused on ocean-driven surface hydrologic influences, neglecting effects of terrestrial hydrology through subsurface connections. Here we evaluate drivers of salt marsh redox potential, a proxy for biogeochemical state, through wavelet analyses and information theory using data from seven marshes. The results point to terrestrial groundwater level as a dominant control on redox variability across all sites. Because redox is a key driver of biogeochemical processes, and specifically oxidation of organic matter that sequesters carbon and maintains marsh elevation, these terrestrial influences are critical to understanding marsh function and evolution. The newly identified links between onshore groundwater levels and marsh redox conditions shift the traditional paradigm and suggest that terrestrial hydrology is a primary control on salt marsh carbon sequestration potential and resilience.

The role of climate and population change in global flood exposure and vulnerability,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56654-8,2025-02-03,Flooding is a pervasive natural hazard with wide-ranging impacts on society. Using a high-resolution global flood model considering coastal, fluvial, and pluvial hazards, we clarify the role of climate effects versus population growth effects in changing flood exposure. Between 2020 and 2100, the population likely exposed to 1% annual risk (100-year) flood hazard will increase from 1.6 to 1.9 billion people. Of this change from the 2020 exposure, we attribute 21.1% to climate change, 76.8% to population change, and 2.1% to both climate and population change. The largest driver of uncertainty in exposure is population change, while climate change remains a smaller but still important driver. The global increase in exposure between 2020 and 2100 is primarily driven by low-GDP regions, and by 2100 the lowest GDP areas will make up 63% of the exposure both overall and in urban areas. Urban areas are especially vulnerable in nearly all global regions, and urban areas sensitive to extreme events are expected to see a 33% increase in population exposure. This study highlights the vast inequities in flood exposure, and future work should direct resources and strategies toward sustainable risk mitigation in these areas.

Recent centennial drought on the Tibetan Plateau is outstanding within the past 3500 years,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56687-z,2025-02-03,Given growing concerns about global climate change, it is critical to understand both historical and current shifts in the hydroclimate, particularly in regions critically entwined with global circulation. The Tibetan Plateau, the Earth’s largest and highest plateau, is a nexus for global atmospheric processes, significantly influencing East Asian hydroclimate dynamics through the synergy of the Asian Monsoon and the Westerlies. Yet, understanding historical and recent hydroclimate fluctuations and their wide-ranging ecological and societal consequences remains challenging due to short instrumental observations and partly ambiguous proxy reconstructions. Here, we present a precisely-dated 3476-year precipitation reconstruction derived from tree-ring δ<sup>18</sup>O data on the Tibetan Plateau, representing one of the few multi-millennia-long annually-resolved terrestrial δ<sup>18</sup>O records to date. Our findings reveal that the 20<sup>th</sup> century drought extremes are severe within the past three millennia, and likely linked to the weakening of both the Asian Monsoon and Westerlies due to anthropogenic aerosol emissions.

Australian water quality trends over two decades show deterioration in the Great Barrier Reef region and recovery in the Murray-Darling Basin,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02044-3,2025-01-29,Understanding river water quality trajectories and drivers is crucial for effective environmental management. Here we present a comprehensive nation-wide water quality trend assessment across Australia with 287 catchments from 2000 to 2019. About half of the catchments show significant trends in the flow-normalised concentration for each parameter analysed. Most of these significant trends are due to changes in concentration-flow relationships rather than long-term trends in flow. Two of Australia’s major river basins show opposing regional patterns in their significant trends. The North East Coast, which largely flows into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, has increasing phosphorus and sediments. This potentially reflects lagged effects of increasing land clearing and fertilisation since 1960s, while land improvement in the region has not yet demonstrated improvement on water quality. The Murray-Darling Basin has decreasing salinity, phosphorus, and sediment, likely driven by effects of a region-scale salinity management interventions and a prolonged drought on catchment processes.

Human-induced water loss potentially threatens sustainable development of sandy regions in China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02046-1,2025-01-30,Water is indispensable for sustainable socioeconomic development, especially in China’s sandy regions. Despite existing studies in sandy regions, the drivers of changes in total water storage and their potential impacts remain inadequately understood. Here we found a 55.97 billion m³ net loss in total water storage from 2002 to 2023 by integrating multiple datasets. Water loss was primarily attributed to increased farmland irrigation (49.56 billion m³) and ecological restoration (37.04 billion m³). In the coming 40 years, water supply capacity will decrease by up to 6.54% and 19.07% under low and high emission scenarios, respectively, requiring reductions in human water consumption of 60% to 135%. This depletion potentially threatens both regional sustainability and national ecological security. This study calls for urgent scientific regulations on water resources, including strict control of local consumption and enhancement of supply capacity.

Global water gaps under future warming levels,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56517-2,2025-01-30,Understanding the impacts of climate change on water resources is crucial for developing effective adaptation strategies. We quantify “water gaps”, or unsustainable water use – the shortfall where water demand exceeds supply, resulting in scarcity. We quantify baseline and future water gaps using a multi-model analysis that incorporates two plausible future warming scenarios. The baseline global water gap stands at 457.9 km<sup>3</sup>/yr, with projections indicating an increase of 26.5 km<sup>3</sup>/yr (+5.8%) and 67.4 km<sup>3</sup>/yr (+14.7%) under 1.5 °C and 3 °C warming scenarios, respectively. These projections highlight the uneven impact of warming levels on water gaps, emphasizing the need for continued climate change mitigation to alleviate stress on water resources. Our results also underscore the unequal adaptation needs across countries and basins, influenced by varying warming scenarios, with important regional differences and model variability complicating future projections. Robust water management strategies are needed to tackle the escalating water scarcity caused by global warming.

Bias-corrected high-resolution temperature and precipitation projections for Canada,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04396-z,2025-02-01,High-resolution precipitation and temperature projections are indispensable for informed decision-making, risk assessment, and planning. Here, we have developed an extensive database (SPQM-CMIP6-CAN) of high-resolution (0.1°) precipitation and temperature projections extending till 2100 at a daily scale for Canada. We employed a novel Semi-Parametric Quantile Mapping (SPQM) methodology to bias-correct the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase-6 (CMIP6) projections for four Shared Socio-economic Pathways. SPQM is simple, yet robust, in reproducing the observed marginal properties, trends, and variability according to future scenarios, while maintaining a smooth transition from observations to projected simulations. The SPQM-CMIP6-CAN database encompasses 693 simulations derived from 34 diverse climate models for precipitation. Similarly, for temperature projections, our database comprises 581 simulations from 27 climate models. These projections are valuable for hydrological, environmental, and ecological studies, offering a comprehensive resource for analyses within these domains. Furthermore, these projections serve as a vital tool for the quantification of uncertainties arising from climate models, their variant configurations, and future scenarios.

The hidden influence of terrestrial groundwater on salt marsh function and resilience,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00384-6,2025-02-03,Salt marshes are hotspots of nutrient processing and carbon sequestration. So far, studies addressing spatiotemporal variability in and drivers of salt marsh biogeochemical function, carbon storage and resilience have focused on ocean-driven surface hydrologic influences, neglecting effects of terrestrial hydrology through subsurface connections. Here we evaluate drivers of salt marsh redox potential, a proxy for biogeochemical state, through wavelet analyses and information theory using data from seven marshes. The results point to terrestrial groundwater level as a dominant control on redox variability across all sites. Because redox is a key driver of biogeochemical processes, and specifically oxidation of organic matter that sequesters carbon and maintains marsh elevation, these terrestrial influences are critical to understanding marsh function and evolution. The newly identified links between onshore groundwater levels and marsh redox conditions shift the traditional paradigm and suggest that terrestrial hydrology is a primary control on salt marsh carbon sequestration potential and resilience.

The role of climate and population change in global flood exposure and vulnerability,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56654-8,2025-02-03,Flooding is a pervasive natural hazard with wide-ranging impacts on society. Using a high-resolution global flood model considering coastal, fluvial, and pluvial hazards, we clarify the role of climate effects versus population growth effects in changing flood exposure. Between 2020 and 2100, the population likely exposed to 1% annual risk (100-year) flood hazard will increase from 1.6 to 1.9 billion people. Of this change from the 2020 exposure, we attribute 21.1% to climate change, 76.8% to population change, and 2.1% to both climate and population change. The largest driver of uncertainty in exposure is population change, while climate change remains a smaller but still important driver. The global increase in exposure between 2020 and 2100 is primarily driven by low-GDP regions, and by 2100 the lowest GDP areas will make up 63% of the exposure both overall and in urban areas. Urban areas are especially vulnerable in nearly all global regions, and urban areas sensitive to extreme events are expected to see a 33% increase in population exposure. This study highlights the vast inequities in flood exposure, and future work should direct resources and strategies toward sustainable risk mitigation in these areas.

Recent centennial drought on the Tibetan Plateau is outstanding within the past 3500 years,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56687-z,2025-02-03,Given growing concerns about global climate change, it is critical to understand both historical and current shifts in the hydroclimate, particularly in regions critically entwined with global circulation. The Tibetan Plateau, the Earth’s largest and highest plateau, is a nexus for global atmospheric processes, significantly influencing East Asian hydroclimate dynamics through the synergy of the Asian Monsoon and the Westerlies. Yet, understanding historical and recent hydroclimate fluctuations and their wide-ranging ecological and societal consequences remains challenging due to short instrumental observations and partly ambiguous proxy reconstructions. Here, we present a precisely-dated 3476-year precipitation reconstruction derived from tree-ring δ<sup>18</sup>O data on the Tibetan Plateau, representing one of the few multi-millennia-long annually-resolved terrestrial δ<sup>18</sup>O records to date. Our findings reveal that the 20<sup>th</sup> century drought extremes are severe within the past three millennia, and likely linked to the weakening of both the Asian Monsoon and Westerlies due to anthropogenic aerosol emissions. Additionally, our analyses identified three distinct stages (110 BC–AD 280, AD 330–770 and AD 950–1300) characterized by shifts toward arid hydroclimate conditions, corresponding to significant social unrest and dynasty collapses, which underscores the potential societal impacts of severe hydroclimatic shifts.

In-soil and above ground microclimate and ET data are presented on a 15-minute interval as are weather data for all days of the year. Data analysis determined ET, precipitation, irrigation, and dew and frost accumulation on a 15-minute basis from lysimeter mass data. Soil water content data from calibrated neutron probe readings is presented on a periodic basis. Crop planting, harvest, fertilization, pest control, and other agronomic information are presented in agronomic calendars by day of year. Crop growth data are presented on a periodic basis throughout the growing season, as are final crop biomass and yield data.

Hyper-resolution naturalized streamflow data for Geum River in South Korea (1951–2020),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04486-y,2025-02-04,Long-term streamflow data at a hyper-resolution (less than 1 km) is essential for hydroclimatic extreme and ecological assessment, which is not available over a river basin where rapid socioeconomic growth have been experienced. Here, we use the Variable Infiltration Capacity-River Routing Model (VIC-RRM) to reconstruct naturalized daily streamflow at 90–meter resolution for the Geum River, one of South Korea’s major rivers, over 1951–2020. VIC-RRM demonstrates high temporal consistency with a correlation coefficient exceeding 0.6 for observed streamflow seasonality at over 60% of the 90 gauge stations along the Geum River. However, 36% of the stations show low modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (0.2–0.4), primarily due to uncertainties in runoff data and human disturbance impacts like irrigation and reservoir storage. Our simulated naturalized data reveal decadal variability in the 1990s and an increase in day-to-day variability of the Geum River in the 2010s compared to those in the 1970s. This dataset provides physically consistent naturalized streamflow data for reference data to evaluate climate change-driven changes in streamflow for the Geum River.

Yet despite the key role that croplands play in global land use and Earth systems, there remains little understanding of how spatial patterns of global crop cultivation have recently evolved and which crops have contributed most to these changes. Here we construct a new data library of subnational crop-specific irrigated and rainfed harvested area statistics and combine it with global gridded land cover products to develop a global gridded (5-arcminute) irrigated and rainfed cropped area (MIRCA-OS) dataset for the years 2000 to 2015 for 23 crop classes. These global data products support critical insights into the spatially detailed patterns of irrigated and rainfed cropland change since the start of the century and provide an improved foundation for a wide array of global assessments spanning agriculture, water resource management, land use change, climate impact, and sustainable development.

To this end, an enhanced rainfall-induced landslide catalogue, e-ITALICA, is presented here. e-ITALICA contains spatial and temporal information on 6312 rainfall-induced landslides that occurred in Italy between 1996 and 2021 (already listed in the previous ITALICA catalogue published in 2023), with the addition of their rainfall triggering conditions in terms of rainfall duration <i>D</i> (h) and cumulative event rainfall <i>E</i> (mm). The triggering conditions are calculated using hourly rainfall measurements from 4033 rain gauges and applying a rigorous and reproducible method. In addition, topographic and land cover information is also provided. e-ITALICA can be used to analyse rainfall conditions capable of triggering landslides, to calibrate and validate physically based landslide prediction models, and to define empirical rainfall thresholds from local to national scales in Italy, thus contributing to landslide risk reduction.

The land–ocean Arctic carbon cycle,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-024-00627-w,2025-02-06,Anthropogenic climate warming is amplified in the Arctic, impacting the Arctic carbon cycle and its role in regulating climate and global biogeochemical cycles. In this Review, we provide a quantitative and comprehensive overview of the present-day Arctic carbon cycle across the land–ocean continuum. Terrestrial soil stocks total 877 ± 16 Pg C, with upper marine sediments containing 82 ± 35 Pg C. Overall, the integrated Arctic system is a carbon sink, driven by oceanic uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> (127 ± 36 Tg C year<sup>−1</sup>) and organic carbon burial in shelf sea sediments (112 ± 41 Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>). Terrestrial systems, including inland waters and disturbance, are a net source of CH<sub>4</sub> (38 (21, 53) Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>) and CO<sub>2</sub> (12 (–606, 661) Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>). The Arctic carbon sink will likely weaken under continued warming, owing to factors such as increased coastal erosion, outgassing of riverine organic carbon and enhanced nearshore carbon turnover lowering shelf sediment burial. Arctic greening and increases in terrestrial carbon sinks will be substantially offset by increases in soil respiration, disturbance from extreme events and enhanced emissions from inland waters. Future research should prioritize enhanced coverage of small catchments and nearshore regions, and inclusion of non-linear responses in biogeochemical models.

However, 36% of the stations show low modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (0.2–0.4), primarily due to uncertainties in runoff data and human disturbance impacts like irrigation and reservoir storage. Our simulated naturalized data reveal decadal variability in the 1990s and an increase in day-to-day variability of the Geum River in the 2010s compared to those in the 1970s. This dataset provides physically consistent naturalized streamflow data for reference data to evaluate climate change-driven changes in streamflow for the Geum River.

A global open-source dataset of monthly irrigated and rainfed cropped areas (MIRCA-OS) for the 21st century,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-04313-w,2025-02-04,Crop production is among the most extensive human activities on the planet – with critical importance for global food security, land use, environmental burden, and climate. Yet despite the key role that croplands play in global land use and Earth systems, there remains little understanding of how spatial patterns of global crop cultivation have recently evolved and which crops have contributed most to these changes. Here we construct a new data library of subnational crop-specific irrigated and rainfed harvested area statistics and combine it with global gridded land cover products to develop a global gridded (5-arcminute) irrigated and rainfed cropped area (MIRCA-OS) dataset for the years 2000 to 2015 for 23 crop classes. These global data products support critical insights into the spatially detailed patterns of irrigated and rainfed cropland change since the start of the century and provide an improved foundation for a wide array of global assessments spanning agriculture, water resource management, land use change, climate impact, and sustainable development.

An enhanced rainfall-induced landslide catalogue in Italy,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04551-6,2025-02-05,With the increasing use of data-driven landslide prediction models also based on artificial intelligence, the availability of accurate information on the occurrence of landslides and the rigorous reconstruction of their triggering rainfall conditions are crucial. To this end, an enhanced rainfall-induced landslide catalogue, e-ITALICA, is presented here. e-ITALICA contains spatial and temporal information on 6312 rainfall-induced landslides that occurred in Italy between 1996 and 2021 (already listed in the previous ITALICA catalogue published in 2023), with the addition of their rainfall triggering conditions in terms of rainfall duration <i>D</i> (h) and cumulative event rainfall <i>E</i> (mm). The triggering conditions are calculated using hourly rainfall measurements from 4033 rain gauges and applying a rigorous and reproducible method. In addition, topographic and land cover information is also provided. e-ITALICA can be used to analyse rainfall conditions capable of triggering landslides, to calibrate and validate physically based landslide prediction models, and to define empirical rainfall thresholds from local to national scales in Italy, thus contributing to landslide risk reduction.

The land–ocean Arctic carbon cycle,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-024-00627-w,2025-02-06,Anthropogenic climate warming is amplified in the Arctic, impacting the Arctic carbon cycle and its role in regulating climate and global biogeochemical cycles. In this Review, we provide a quantitative and comprehensive overview of the present-day Arctic carbon cycle across the land–ocean continuum. Terrestrial soil stocks total 877 ± 16 Pg C, with upper marine sediments containing 82 ± 35 Pg C. Overall, the integrated Arctic system is a carbon sink, driven by oceanic uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> (127 ± 36 Tg C year<sup>−1</sup>) and organic carbon burial in shelf sea sediments (112 ± 41 Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>). Terrestrial systems, including inland waters and disturbance, are a net source of CH<sub>4</sub> (38 (21, 53) Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>) and CO<sub>2</sub> (12 (–606, 661) Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>). The Arctic carbon sink will likely weaken under continued warming, owing to factors such as increased coastal erosion, outgassing of riverine organic carbon and enhanced nearshore carbon turnover lowering shelf sediment burial. Arctic greening and increases in terrestrial carbon sinks will be substantially offset by increases in soil respiration, disturbance from extreme events and enhanced emissions from inland waters. Future research should prioritize enhanced coverage of small catchments and nearshore regions, and inclusion of non-linear responses in biogeochemical models.

Not as random: the stable dynamics controlling shallow convective clouds,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00924-1,2025-02-07,Shallow, sparse, non-precipitating convective clouds forming over the ocean are considered among the least organized cloud fields. The formation mechanism of these clouds is associated with random, local perturbations that create buoyant parcels. Their sparseness suggests no or very weak interactions between clouds. Here, we show that such clouds form within a well-organized, stable, dense mesh of convective cells that operate continuously, independent of the presence of visible clouds.npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Rising groundwater table due to restoration projects amplifies earthquake induced liquefaction risk in Beijing,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56525-2,2025-02-08,Groundwater restoration is increasingly common to mitigate groundwater overexploitation, which proves effective in resolving urban water scarcity and regional unsustainable development. China’s South-to-North Water Diversion Project is one of the largest water transfer projects to restore groundwater and resolve water shortage in Beijing. However, how the rapidly restored groundwater of this magnitude changes regional seismic stability is largely unknown. Here, we explore the relation between elevated groundwater table and seismic ground liquefaction based on the case of Beijing under the impact of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. We collect groundwater table depth records and use them to drive three-dimensional geotechnical models that generate ground liquefaction hazard maps. We find a remarkable increase in coverage and severity of liquefaction due to groundwater table rise. Infrastructures built during the rapid urbanization process are often under low groundwater table and thus illy prepared for this increased seismic risk. These findings highlight the necessity to consider the seismic consequence of large-scale groundwater restoration projects.,Nature Communications
Wildfires mediate carbon transfer from land to lakes across boreal and temperate regions,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02070-1,2025-02-08,Wildfires can disrupt carbon transport from land to water, but how lake carbon cycling responds to fires remains unclear. Here, we analyzed the concentration and dominance of the main carbon forms in total carbon pools in 54 lakes (34 burned, 20 control) across 3 regions of Quebec, Canada and Minnesota, USA from recent wildfires ( &lt; 1 – 3 years). Lakes in burned watersheds had up to double the dissolved organic carbon concentrations of control lakes, and the fire effect was most apparent when accounting for climate and landscape drivers (e.g., catchment to lake area ratio) of lake carbon cycling. The greater quantity and dominance of dissolved organic carbon in burned lakes over other carbon forms with different turnover rates and fates suggest a potential fire-mediated carbon export up to several years post fire with a yet undetermined fate in northern forested watersheds and with important implications for regional to global carbon budgets.,Communications Earth & Environment
An annotated satellite imagery dataset for automated river barrier object detection,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04590-z,2025-02-10,Millions of river barriers have been constructed worldwide for flood control, hydropower generation, and agricultural irrigation. The lack of comprehensive records on river barriers’ locations and types, particularly small barriers including weirs, limits our ability to assess their societal and environmental impacts. Integrating satellite imagery with object detection algorithms holds promise for the automatic identification of river barriers on a global scale. However, achieving this objective requires high-quality image datasets for algorithm training and testing. Hence, this study presents a large-scale dataset named the River Barrier Object Detection (RBOD). It comprises 4,872 high-resolution satellite images and 11,741 meticulously annotated oriented bounding boxes (OBBs), encompassing five classes of river barriers. The effectiveness of the RBOD dataset was validated using five typical object detection algorithms, which provide performance benchmarks for future applications. To the best of our knowledge, RBOD is the first publicly available dataset for river barrier object detection, providing a valuable resource for the understanding and management of river barriers.,Scientific Data
Emergent constraints indicate slower increases in future global evapotranspiration,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00932-1,2025-02-12,Projections of global terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) are plagued by sizeable uncertainties. Here, we uncover bivariate emergent constraint relationships between projected global ET trends (2015–2100) and historical vapour pressure deficit (VPD) trends (1980–2014) under the low emission scenario of SSP126 when water supply is sufficient, and with historical precipitation trends under the high emission scenarios of SSP370 and SSP585 when water availability is limited, across 28 CMIP6 models. Combining multiple observational datasets into a Hierarchical Emergent Constraint framework, we find the raw CMIP6 models overestimate future annual ET growth rates. The original projections of 0.233 ± 0.107 mm year<sup>−1</sup> (SSP126), 0.360 ± 0.244 mm year−<sup>1</sup> (SSP370) and 0.506 ± 0.365 mm year<sup>−1</sup> (SSP585) are adjusted downwards to 0.193 ± 0.074 mm year<sup>−1</sup>, 0.272 ± 0.184 mm year<sup>−1</sup> and 0.391 ± 0.299 mm year<sup>−1</sup>. The revised projection uncertainties are reduced by 18.1–31.1%. These findings highlight the value of incorporating observational constraints to improve the reliability of ET projections, which are critical for understanding the future global water cycle.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Contrasting impacts of irrigation and deforestation on Lancang-Mekong River Basin hydrology,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02093-8,2025-02-12,Irrigation expansion and subsequent deforestation substantially affect large basin variability. However, given the complex interactions between hydrological variables, a more comprehensive understanding of the hydrological impacts within the coexisting land use changes is needed. Here, we applied surface-groundwater-coupled simulations with historical river gauges and satellite observations to evaluate long-term and seasonal changes in Lancang-Mekong River Basin hydrology. Increasing irrigation elevated soil moisture but depleted groundwater storage. Conversely, deforestation reduced soil moisture, and increased lateral flow in areas with steep terrain compensated for groundwater depletion. Irrigation affected runoff by augmenting evapotranspiration and baseflow, which had opposite implications for runoff changes, causing a mixed spatial pattern of decreases and increases. Meanwhile, decreases in soil moisture due to deforestation offset increases in evapotranspiration due to irrigation, resulting in wider areas of runoff increases than decreases. These illustrate the distinct hydrological impacts of different land use changes and a pathway to complex system assessments.,Communications Earth & Environment
Deciphering the role of evapotranspiration in declining relative humidity trends over land,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02076-9,2025-02-12,In recent decades, relative humidity over land has declined, driving increases in droughts and wildfires. Previous explanations attribute this trend to insufficient moisture advection from the ocean to sustain the current level, but this ignores atmospheric moisture supplied from terrestrial evapotranspiration. Importantly, current state-of-the-art climate models continue to underestimate the observed relative humidity trend over land. Here, we show that changes in specific humidity over land relative to a given baseline, unaccounted for by ocean advection, are quantitatively equivalent to relative changes in evapotranspiration on a global scale. This finding is consistent across climate models and climate reanalysis datasets, despite discrepancies in evapotranspiration trends among them. Differences in evapotranspiration trends are identified as a prominent cause of the bias in relative humidity trend expressed in climate models. These results suggest that current climate models may overestimate evapotranspiration intensifications, leading to an underestimation of atmospheric drying, with critical implications for accurately predicting droughts, wildfires, and climate adaptation.,Communications Earth & Environment
A high resolution, gridded product for vapor pressure deficit using Daymet,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04544-5,2025-02-12,Vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is a critical variable in assessing drought conditions and evaluating plant water stress. Gridded products of global and regional VPD are not freely available from satellite remote sensing, model reanalysis, or ground observation datasets. We present two versions of the first gridded VPD product for the Continental US and parts of Northern Mexico and Southern Canada (CONUS+) at a 1 km spatial resolution and daily time step. We derived VPD from Daymet maximum daily temperature and average daily vapor pressure and scale the estimates based on (1) climate determined by the Köppen-Geiger classifications and (2) land cover determined by the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme. Ground-based VPD data from 253 AmeriFlux sites representing different climate and land cover classifications were used to improve the Daymet-derived VPD estimates for every pixel in the CONUS+ grid to produce the final datasets. We evaluated the Daymet-derived VPD against independent observations and reanalysis data. The CONUS+ VPD datasets will aid in investigating disturbances including drought and wildfire, and informing land management strategies.,Scientific Data

Original vegetation condition and precipitation growth rate bifurcate sediment flux trend on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02075-w,2025-02-07,Riverine sediment flux on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau follows separate trends in different headwater basins because of complicated pathways under global warming. Here we successfully reconstructed historical sediment fluxes from seven pathways at 25 hydrological stations during 1982 ~ 2022 using a conceptual Multivariate Climate Elasticity Model based on Taylor expansion and revealed the bifurcation in sediment flux trend. Significantly increasing trends occurred at five stations, caused either by elevated runoff from increased precipitation (contributing -10 ~ 50%) or by temperature modifying the underlying surface (-12 ~ 100%). Significantly decreasing trends were found at six stations, primarily owing to vegetation expansion (11 ~ 100%). Combinations of original vegetation condition and increasing rate of precipitation are pivotal for bifurcating the sediment flux trend. In the future, slowly increasing precipitation with greatly increasing temperature or poor original vegetation condition followed by rapid vegetation expansion may decelerate sediment yield, whereas rapidly increasing precipitation may overwhelm the marginal conservation effect of plentiful vegetation.,Communications Earth & Environment

Gridded products of global and regional VPD are not freely available from satellite remote sensing, model reanalysis, or ground observation datasets. We present two versions of the first gridded VPD product for the Continental US and parts of Northern Mexico and Southern Canada (CONUS+) at a 1 km spatial resolution and daily time step. We derived VPD from Daymet maximum daily temperature and average daily vapor pressure and scale the estimates based on (1) climate determined by the Köppen-Geiger classifications and (2) land cover determined by the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme. Ground-based VPD data from 253 AmeriFlux sites representing different climate and land cover classifications were used to improve the Daymet-derived VPD estimates for every pixel in the CONUS+ grid to produce the final datasets. We evaluated the Daymet-derived VPD against independent observations and reanalysis data. The CONUS+ VPD datasets will aid in investigating disturbances including drought and wildfire, and informing land management strategies.,Scientific DataDeciphering the role of evapotranspiration in declining relative humidity trends over land,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02076-9,2025-02-12,In recent decades, relative humidity over land has declined, driving increases in droughts and wildfires. Previous explanations attribute this trend to insufficient moisture advection from the ocean to sustain the current level, but this ignores atmospheric moisture supplied from terrestrial evapotranspiration. Importantly, current state-of-the-art climate models continue to underestimate the observed relative humidity trend over land. Here, we show that changes in specific humidity over land relative to a given baseline, unaccounted for by ocean advection, are quantitatively equivalent to relative changes in evapotranspiration on a global scale. This finding is consistent across climate models and climate reanalysis datasets, despite discrepancies in evapotranspiration trends among them. Differences in evapotranspiration trends are identified as a prominent cause of the bias in relative humidity trend expressed in climate models. These results suggest that current climate models may overestimate evapotranspiration intensifications, leading to an underestimation of atmospheric drying, with critical implications for accurately predicting droughts, wildfires, and climate adaptation.,Communications Earth & Environment

Climate change effects on submarine groundwater discharge and regional variations along the Korean Peninsula,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02084-9,2025-02-14,Climate change impacts fresh submarine groundwater discharge on the Korean Peninsula, increasing the vulnerability of coastal regions to environmental degradation and economic consequences. Here, we provide regional estimates of fresh submarine groundwater discharge along the entire coast using established water balance methods. Our findings reveal that the western and southern coasts of the southern Korean Peninsula exhibit higher fresh submarine groundwater discharge rates due to greater net precipitation compared to the northern Korean Peninsula. Differences in drainage length between the east and west coasts, along with substantial tidal flats, significantly influence submarine groundwater discharge rates. Climate change drives variations in fresh submarine groundwater discharge, with rising trends in the southern Korean Peninsula during spring and winter, while the northern coastal watersheds show consistent increases across all seasons. Coastal vulnerability to offshore contamination from land use development affects 15% of the coastline. Notably, between 1990 and 2020, the risk in the southern Korean Peninsula’s coastal catchments increased by 38%. Our analysis also highlights heightened vulnerability to saltwater intrusion in the southwestern Korean Peninsula.,Communications Earth & Environment
The Water Health Open Knowledge Graph,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04537-4,2025-02-15,Global sustainability challenges have recently led to an increasing interest in the management of water and health resources. Thus, the availability of effective, meaningful and open data is crucial to address those issues in the broader context of the Sustainable Development Goals of clean water and sanitation as targeted by the United Nations. In this paper, we present the Water Health Open Knowledge Graph (WHOW-KG) along with its design methodology and analysis on impact. Developed in the context of the EU-funded WHOW (Water Health Open Knowledge) project, the WHOW-KG is a semantic knowledge graph that models data on water consumption, pollution, extreme weather events, infectious disease rates and drug distribution. Indeed, it aims at supporting a wide range of applications: from knowledge discovery to decision-making, making it a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners in the water and health domains. The WHOW-KG consists of a network of five ontologies and related linked open data, modelled according to those ontologies. As a fully distributed system, it is sustainable over time, can handle large datasets, and allows data providers full control, establishing it as a vital European asset in the fields of water consumption and pollution.,Scientific Data
Progressively smaller glacier lake outburst floods despite worldwide growth in lake area,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-025-00388-w,2025-02-18,Glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs) may originate from larger lakes as these continue to grow with ongoing glacier retreat; however, this perception remains poorly supported in available GLOF databases. Here we mapped the areas of 1,686 glacier lakes, just before they drained, across 13 glaciated mountain regions outside polar regions and examined the trends in pre-GLOF lake areas between 1990 and 2023. We found that pre-GLOF lake areas barely changed, or even decreased, regionally through time, even as the total lake area, and thus hazard potential, grew overall. This counterintuitive finding reflects limits to growing GLOF magnitudes, such as the decoupling of lakes and parent glaciers, the development of wide, low-gradient outlets or human management. Across all regions, pre-GLOF lake areas depend on a few ice-dammed lakes, which have produced ten times more reported outbursts and ten times larger outbursts than moraine- and bedrock-dammed lakes. The latter two dam types will continue to impound growing amounts of meltwater, thereby accounting for most of the overall GLOF hazard potential, while ice-dammed lakes will shrink with deglaciation. As these lake types will evolve differently in the twenty-first century, we call for customized simulations of GLOF outflows and impacts, given the growing exposure of critical infrastructure.,Nature Water
Community estimate of global glacier mass changes from 2000 to 2023,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08545-z,2025-02-19,Glaciers are indicators of ongoing anthropogenic climate change<sup>1</sup>. Their melting leads to increased local geohazards<sup>2</sup>, and impacts marine<sup>3</sup> and terrestrial<sup>4,5</sup> ecosystems, regional freshwater resources<sup>6</sup>, and both global water and energy cycles<sup>7,8</sup>. Together with the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, glaciers are essential drivers of present<sup>9,10</sup> and future<sup>11,12,13</sup> sea-level rise. Previous assessments of global glacier mass changes have been hampered by spatial and temporal limitations and the heterogeneity of existing data series<sup>14,15,16</sup>. Here we show in an intercomparison exercise that glaciers worldwide lost 273 ± 16 gigatonnes in mass annually from 2000 to 2023, with an increase of 36 ± 10% from the first (2000–2011) to the second (2012–2023) half of the period. Since 2000, glaciers have lost between 2% and 39% of their ice regionally and about 5% globally. Glacier mass loss is about 18% larger than the loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet and more than twice that from the Antarctic Ice Sheet<sup>17</sup>. Our results arise from a scientific community effort to collect, homogenize, combine and analyse glacier mass changes from in situ and remote-sensing observations. Although our estimates are in agreement with findings from previous assessments<sup>14,15,16</sup> at a global scale, we found some large regional deviations owing to systematic differences among observation methods. Our results provide a refined baseline for better understanding observational differences and for calibrating model ensembles<sup>12,16,18</sup>, which will help to narrow projection uncertainty for the twenty-first century<sup>11,12,18</sup>.,Nature
UAS hydrometry: contactless river water level, bathymetry, and flow velocity – the Rӧnne river dataset,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04611-x,2025-02-19,High-resolution monitoring of rivers becomes important because more frequent and severe flooding and drought events are expected in the future, caused by climate change. Some key hydrometric variables (water surface elevation, bathymetry, and water surface velocity) can be acquired at high spatial resolution and in a contactless and noninvasive way using Unoccupied Aerial Systems (UAS). This paper presents a large publicly available UAS hydrometric dataset surveyed within a 10 km stretch of Rönne Å in Sweden from 28 August to 1 September 2023. The data were acquired using UAS radar altimetry for water surface elevation mapping, UAS water penetrating radar and UAS sonar for bathymetric mapping, and UAS Doppler radar for surface velocity monitoring. All data are divided into three processing levels: the raw data (Level 1), processed point data (Level 2), and point data referenced to a reference river centerline/reference cross section line (Level 3). In-situ ground truth and legacy UAS hydrometry payload data are included for comparison and validation. Good consistency indicates that the new UAS hydrometry payloads provide satisfactory datasets.,Scientific Data
Global Future Drought Layers Based on Downscaled CMIP6 Models and Multiple Socioeconomic Pathways,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04612-w,2025-02-19,Droughts are a natural hazard of growing concern as they are projected to increase in frequency and severity for many regions of the world. The identification of droughts and their future characteristics is essential to building an understanding of the geography and magnitude of potential drought change trajectories, which in turn is critical information to manage drought resilience across multiple sectors and disciplines. Adding to this effort, we developed a dataset of global historical and projected future drought indices over the 1980–2100 period based on downscaled CMIP6 models across multiple shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP). The dataset is composed of two indices: the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) for 23 downscaled global climate models (GCMs) (0.25-degree resolution), including historical (1980–2014) and future projections (2015–2100) under four climate scenarios: SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5. The drought indices were calculated for 3-, 6- and 12-month accumulation timescales and are available as gridded spatial datasets in a regular latitude-longitude format at monthly time resolution.,Scientific Data

A dataset for monitoring agricultural drought in Europe,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-04199-8,2025-02-20,This paper introduces the Combined Drought Indicator dataset, a collection of raster maps generated by the Copernicus European Drought Observatory for monitoring agricultural drought in Europe. Computationally, the CDI involves three indicators: the Standardized Precipitation Index, the Soil Moisture Anomaly and the Fraction of the Photosyntetically Active Radiation anomaly. These are complemented by the use of crop and snow masks. The CDI dataset has a spatial resolution of 1/24 decimal degrees (∼5 km), a temporal resolution of 10 days and is available from 2012 onward. As drought effects are variegated both in space and time, the CDI provides an effective instrument for assessing the different stages of propagation of agricultural drought and their spatial extent. Furthermore, the CDI maps provide relevant information for those private and public actors (water resource agencies, farmers, land managers and so on) involved both in drought preparedness and planning to mitigate drought impacts. Users can access and download the dataset from the Copernicus European Drought Observatory web portal, where an online mapviewer and clickable maps facilitate its interactive exploration.,Scientific Data
Waterfalls enhance regional methane emissions by enabling dissolved methane to bypass microbial oxidation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02060-3,2025-02-23,River waters are significant sources of atmospheric methane whose local emissions increase with river slope and turbulence. However, when integrated regionally, the amount of dissolved methane released to the atmosphere is uninfluenced by local changes in turbulence when no additional loss mechanisms are present. Here we tested the hypothesis that waterfalls enhance both local and regional atmospheric methane emissions if microbial methane oxidation is significant in river waters. Rates of net atmospheric emission and net aerobic methane oxidation were measured in river waters containing waterfalls across western New York revealing that methane oxidation can diminish atmospheric emissions when turbulence is less. However, at waterfalls, 88 ± 1% of the dissolved methane supersaturation was released to the atmosphere, increasing net methane emission rates substantially beyond oxidation (0.1–16.2 × 10<sup>6 </sup>nM d<sup>-1</sup> for waterfall emission; 10–39 nM d<sup>-1</sup> for oxidation), and ultimately enhancing regional methane emissions by enabling dissolved methane to bypass an oxidative sink.,Communications Earth & Environment
A 150-year river water quality record shows reductions in phosphorus loads but not in algal growth potential,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01978-4,2025-02-24,Eutrophication and proliferation of nuisance and harmful algal blooms are a major cause of water-quality impairment globally. Here, we analyze the world’s longest continuous (150-year) river water-quality dataset for the River Thames, U.K. (including biological oxygen demand, chloride, phosphorus and silica), to explore the impacts of urbanization, wastewater discharges and agricultural intensification. Over the last 40 years, improvements in wastewater treatment and agricultural management have reduced phosphorus loads by ~80%. However, this has been insufficient to curtail river algal blooms because nutrient concentrations remain above limiting levels. Over the last 50–60 years, rising water temperatures have increased the number of days with water temperatures favourable for diatom blooms in March-April and for cyanobacterial growth in July-August. These results highlight the challenges of eutrophication management in a warming climate and a strategic need to redouble efforts in further reducing nutrient emissions to control nuisance and increasingly harmful algal blooms.,Communications Earth & Environment
A station-based 0.1-degree daily gridded ensemble precipitation dataset for India,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04474-2,2025-02-25,Gridded precipitation products are inherently uncertain and predominantly deterministic, which limits their applicability in data assimilation systems and hydrologic modeling. This limitation is significant in developing countries such as India, where the observation network is sparse and non-uniform, topography is complex, and hydrometeorological extremes are frequent. The current official 0.25° observed precipitation dataset of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) is deterministic and based on Shephard’s interpolation technique. To address these challenges, we have developed the Indian Precipitation Ensemble Dataset (IPED) leveraging the largest network of precipitation gauge stations across India and using a locally weighted spatial regression approach. IPED is a daily 30-member ensemble precipitation product available at 0.1° and 0.25° resolution (1991–2020), accounting for topographical variation in elevation, slope, and aspect. For all thresholds, including the extreme 99<sup>th</sup> percentile precipitation during monsoon, the developed ensemble product exhibits higher discrimination and reliability. This is the first observation-based ensemble precipitation product over India and is expected to have widespread hydrometeorological applications.,Scientific Data

Current precipitation products for the TP often lack sufficient spatial or temporal resolution, hindering accurate characterization and mitigation of precipitation-related hazards. Here, we carry out 10-year (2012–2021, June to September) convection-permitting model simulations based on the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model over the TP. We adopt four one-way nested domains, with the innermost domain providing a 1-km, hourly resolution over the southeastern TP. Model performance is enhanced using a spectral nudging scheme. Our simulated precipitation data are compared against in-situ rain gauge observations and state-of-the-art gridded precipitation products (i.e., HAR v2, ERA5-Land, and IMERG) over the  southeastern TP. Our precipitation dataset demonstrates superior accuracy in mean absolute error, root mean square error, and bias, compared to the other three products. It effectively captures the key feature of the diurnal precipitation cycle and the non-monotonic dependence of precipitation on complex topography over the southeastern TP.,Scientific Data

Extreme drought-heatwave events threaten the biodiversity and stability of aquatic plankton communities in the Yangtze River ecosystems,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02143-1,2025-03-01,Rivers are crucial to biogeochemical cycles, connecting terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric systems. However, their ecosystems are increasingly threatened by extreme weather events. Here we used the environmental DNA approach to assess the impact of extreme drought-heatwave events on the aquatic plankton communities of the Yangtze River. We showed that an extreme drought-heatwave event reduced the α diversity of communities, increased their β diversity, and simultaneously simplified and destabilized community network structure. This event also shifted the dominant algae taxa from Bacillariophyta to Cyanobacteria, accompanied by increases in organic carbon and labile organic carbon contents. Globally, temperature rises during this extreme drought-heatwave event are more pronounced in high-latitude regions, likely amplifying impacts on river ecosystem biodiversity and stability. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of river ecosystems to extreme events and underscore the need to mitigate climate change’s effects on river ecosystems.,Communications Earth & Environment

The point validation between simulated and observed snow depth across control points shows the accuracy of the dataset in simulating the normal and relatively high snow conditions, respectively. Additionally, satellite snow cover maps have been compared with simulated snow depth maps, as a function of elevation and aspect. 2D Validation shows accurate values over time and space, expressed in terms of snowline along the cardinal directions.,Scientific Data

However, their ecosystems are increasingly threatened by extreme weather events. Here we used the environmental DNA approach to assess the impact of extreme drought-heatwave events on the aquatic plankton communities of the Yangtze River. We showed that an extreme drought-heatwave event reduced the α diversity of communities, increased their β diversity, and simultaneously simplified and destabilized community network structure. This event also shifted the dominant algae taxa from Bacillariophyta to Cyanobacteria, accompanied by increases in organic carbon and labile organic carbon contents. Globally, temperature rises during this extreme drought-heatwave event are more pronounced in high-latitude regions, likely amplifying impacts on river ecosystem biodiversity and stability. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of river ecosystems to extreme events and underscore the need to mitigate climate change’s effects on river ecosystems.,Communications Earth & Environment
30-years (1991-2021) Snow Water Equivalent Dataset in the Po River District, Italy,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04633-5,2025-03-04,This paper presents a long-term snow water equivalent dataset in the Po River District, Italy, spanning from 1991 to 2021 at daily time step and 500 m spatial resolution partially covering the mountain ranges of Alps and Apennines. The data has been generated using a hybrid modelling approach integrating the hydrological modelling conducted with the physically-based GEOtop model, preprocessing of the meteorological data, and assimilation of in-situ snow measurements and Earth Observation snow products to enhance the quality of the model estimates. A rigorous quality assessment of the dataset has been performed at different control points selected based on reliability, quality, and territorial distribution. The point validation between simulated and observed snow depth across control points shows the accuracy of the dataset in simulating the normal and relatively high snow conditions, respectively. Additionally, satellite snow cover maps have been compared with simulated snow depth maps, as a function of elevation and aspect. 2D Validation shows accurate values over time and space, expressed in terms of snowline along the cardinal directions.,Scientific Data
Impact of Amazonian deforestation on precipitation reverses between seasons,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08570-y,2025-03-05,Tropical deforestation was found to cause large reductions in precipitation using a range of observation-based datasets<sup>1</sup>. However, the limitations of satellite-based space-for-time statistical analysis have hindered understanding of the roles of reshaped mesoscale atmospheric circulation and regional precipitation recycling at different scales. These effects are considered nonlocal effects, which are distinct from the local effects governed by deforestation-induced reductions in evapotranspiration (ET). Here we show reversed precipitation responses to Amazon deforestation across wet and dry seasons. During the wet season, deforested grids experienced a noteworthy increase in precipitation (0.96 mm month<sup>−1</sup> per percentage point forest loss), primarily attributed to enhanced mesoscale atmospheric circulation (that is, nonlocal effect). These nonlocal increases weaken with distance from deforested grids, leading to significant precipitation reductions in buffers beyond 60 km. Conversely, during the dry season, precipitation decreases in deforested grids and throughout all analysis buffers, with local effects from reduced ET dominating. Our findings highlight the intricate balance between local effects and nonlocal effects in driving deforestation–precipitation responses across different seasons and scales and emphasize the urgent need to address the rapid and extensive loss of forest in the Amazon region.,Nature
Discrete fracture network modelling reconstructs fracture array evolution and related petrophysical properties over geological time,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02146-y,2025-03-05,Fractured rock petrophysical studies rarely use temporal constraints, thus hindering fracture-related permeability and connectivity estimation during past geofluid migration. Here we present a conceptual approach, using a stochastic method incorporating absolute ages to reconstruct fracture arrays back in geological time. Generating ‘grown’ discrete fracture network models, we simulate the hydraulic behaviour of fractured rock volumes from the late-Cretaceous/Palaeocene to the Devonian, via progressive fracture back-stripping. We reveal that for the examined rock mass, maximum principal permeability increased through time from 9.47e-14 m<sup>2</sup> to 4.44e-13 m<sup>2</sup> (~3 orders of magnitude) along with the maximum horizontal permeability orientation shifting from NE-SW to NW-SE. Similarly, the connectivity metric increased with fracture saturation, peaking in the mid-Cretaceous. For comparison, dated offshore hydrocarbon secondary migration potentially coincides with our results. Back-stripping of time-constrained fracture sets is therefore a powerful method to investigate and quantify the dynamic evolution of petrophysical properties through geological time.,Communications Earth & Environment
An annotated Dataset and Benchmark for Detecting Floating Debris in Inland Waters,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04594-9,2025-03-05,Marine litter is a serious threat to marine ecosystems, and the timely removal of floating waste from inland waters is effective in preventing floating debris from entering the sea. An accurate object detection system is a prerequisite for efficiently clearing floaters. However, complex light conditions in the water, small size objects and other factors pose a huge challenge for floating object detection. In order to facilitate the solution of the floating object pollution problem and promote the application of AI technology in the water industry, we proposed the first floater dataset of waters collected from real water scenarios based on shore-based filming equipment, IWHR_AI_Lable_Floater_V1. The dataset consists of 3000 images containing accurate annotation information to support vision-based water surface floater detection tasks. We conducted a number of baseline experiments to evaluate the performance of mainstream object detection algorithms on this dataset. The results show that the detection accuracies of the models, including the state-of-the-art model YOLOv9, are all low, which also indicates that floating object detection is a challenging task.,Scientific Data
Divergent response of aridity index to historical land use and land cover change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00978-1,2025-03-05,By using model simulations, we show that historical land use and land cover change since 1850 has impacted aridity index (AI) worldwide, causing divergent responses in different regions. Locally, AI tends to increase (getting humid) in reforestation regions and most humid regions. Owing to these changes, the area of the humid zone expanded insignificantly by 0.22% of the global land area at the expense of drylands.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
A Comprehensive Dataset of Surface Water Quality Spanning 1940-2023 for Empirical and ML Adopted Research,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04715-4,2025-03-06,Assessment and monitoring of surface water quality are essential for food security, public health, and ecosystem protection. Although water quality monitoring is a known phenomenon, little effort has been made to offer a comprehensive and harmonized dataset for surface water at the global scale. This study presents a comprehensive surface water quality dataset that preserves spatio-temporal variability, integrity, consistency, and depth of the data to facilitate empirical and data-driven evaluation, prediction, and forecasting. The dataset is assembled from a range of sources, including regional and global water quality databases, water management organizations, and individual research projects from five prominent countries in the world, e.g., the USA, Canada, Ireland, England, and China. The resulting dataset consists of 2.82 million measurements of eight water quality parameters that span 1940 - 2023. This dataset can support meta-analysis of water quality models and can facilitate Machine Learning (ML) based data and model-driven investigation of the spatial and temporal drivers and patterns of surface water quality at a cross-regional to global scale.,Scientific Data
Bedmap3 updated ice bed, surface and thickness gridded datasets for Antarctica,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04672-y,2025-03-10,We present Bedmap3, the latest suite of gridded products describing surface elevation, ice-thickness and the seafloor and subglacial bed elevation of the Antarctic south of 60 °S. Bedmap3 incorporates and adds to all post-1950s datasets previously used for Bedmap2, including 84 new aero-geophysical surveys by 15 data providers, an additional 52 million data points and 1.9 million line-kilometres of measurement. These efforts have filled notable gaps including in major mountain ranges and the deep interior of East Antarctica, along West Antarctic coastlines and on the Antarctic Peninsula. Our new Bedmap3/RINGS grounding line similarly consolidates multiple recent mappings into a single, spatially coherent feature. Combined with updated maps of surface topography, ice shelf thickness, rock outcrops and bathymetry, Bedmap3 reveals in much greater detail the subglacial landscape and distribution of Antarctica’s ice, providing new opportunities to interpret continental-scale landscape evolution and to model the past and future evolution of the Antarctic ice sheets.,Scientific Data
GLEAM4: global land evaporation and soil moisture dataset at 0.1 resolution from 1980 to near present,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04610-y,2025-03-10,Terrestrial evaporation plays a crucial role in modulating climate and water resources. Here, we present a continuous, daily dataset covering 1980–2023 with a 0.1°spatial resolution, produced using the fourth generation of the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM). GLEAM4 embraces developments in hybrid modelling, learning evaporative stress from eddy-covariance and sapflow data. It features improved representation of key factors such as interception, atmospheric water demand, soil moisture, and plant access to groundwater. Estimates are inter-compared with existing global evaporation products and validated against in situ measurements, including data from 473 eddy-covariance sites, showing a median correlation of 0.73, root-mean-square error of 0.95 mm d<sup>−1</sup>, and Kling–Gupta efficiency of 0.49. Global land evaporation is estimated at 68.5 × 10<sup>3</sup> km<sup>3</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>, with 62% attributed to transpiration. Beyond actual evaporation and its components (transpiration, interception loss, soil evaporation, etc.), the dataset also provides soil moisture, potential evaporation, sensible heat flux, and evaporative stress, facilitating a wide range of hydrological, climatic, and ecological studies.,Scientific Data
A kinematic analysis of extratropical cyclones, warm conveyor belts and atmospheric rivers,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00942-z,2025-03-10,Mid-latitude weather systems play a significant role in causing floods, wind damage, and related societal impacts. Advances in numerical modeling and observational methods have led to the development of numerous conceptual models in mid-latitude synoptic and dynamical research. As these models proliferate, integrating new insights into a cohesive understanding can be challenging. This paper uses a kinematic perspective to interpret mid-latitude research in a way that synthesises various concepts and create a schematic diagram of an atmospheric river lifecycle. Our analysis demonstrates that, despite varying methods, definitions, and terminology used to describe extratropical cyclones, warm conveyor belt airflows, and atmospheric rivers, the underlying mechanisms driving their formation and development are consistent. Thus, while studying these features independently is valuable, it is important to recognise that they are all part of a larger atmospheric flow pattern. We hope this kinematic approach will serve as a bridge to link research on these phenomena.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science

FloodCastBench: A Large-Scale Dataset and Foundation Models for Flood Modeling and Forecasting,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04725-2,2025-03-12,Effective flood forecasting is crucial for informed decision-making and emergency response. Existing flood datasets mainly describe flood events but lack dynamic process data suitable for machine learning (ML). This work introduces the FloodCastBench dataset, designed for ML-based flood modeling and forecasting, featuring four major flood events: Pakistan 2022, UK 2015, Australia 2022, and Mozambique 2019. FloodCastBench details the process of flood dynamics data acquisition, starting with input data preparation (e.g., topography, land use, rainfall) and flood measurement data collection (e.g., SAR-based maps, surveyed outlines) for hydrodynamic modeling. We deploy a widely recognized finite difference numerical solution to construct high-resolution spatiotemporal dynamic processes with 30-m spatial and 300-second temporal resolutions. Flood measurement data are used to calibrate the hydrodynamic model parameters and validate the flood inundation maps. FloodCastBench provides comprehensive low-fidelity and high-fidelity flood forecasting datasets specifically for ML. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark of foundational models for neural flood forecasting using FloodCastBench, validating its effectiveness in supporting ML models for spatiotemporal, cross-regional, and downscaled flood forecasting.,Scientific Data
Increasing hourly heavy rainfall in Austria reflected in flood changes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08647-2,2025-03-12,Climate change is expected to increase heavy rainfall with concomitant increases in flooding<sup>1</sup>. Causes of increased heavy rainfall include the higher water-holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere and changes in atmospheric circulation patterns<sup>2</sup>, which may translate into future heavy rainfall increases in most of Europe<sup>3</sup>. However, gathering evidence on the time evolution of past changes has been hampered by data limitations and measurement uncertainties, in particular for short rainfall durations, such as 1 h. Here we show an 8% increase in daily and 15% increase in hourly heavy rainfall over the last four decades by analysing a new dataset comprising 883 stations in Austria from 1900 to 2023. These increases are fully consistent between two independent networks and occurred after a retarding phase between 1960 and 1980. Hourly heavy rainfall changes are aligned with temperature increases with the sensitivity of a 7% increase per 1 °C of warming, in line with Clausius–Clapeyron scaling. Daily heavy rainfall changes, however, are aligned with atmospheric circulation indices with little correlation to air temperature, which suggests a bigger role of atmospheric circulation modes than previously thought. The daily heavy rainfall changes are remarkably consistent with observed flood increases of about 8% in large catchments. The hourly heavy rainfall changes are similarly consistent with flood changes in small catchments, although the flood increase is stronger (25% over the last four decades). Climate adaptation measures in flood management may therefore be more pressing for rivers draining smaller catchment areas than for large rivers.,Nature

Based on the trilinear graph of S<sub>y</sub> and soil textures, we develop a comprehensive global dataset of gridded average specific yield (GASY) aimed for various soil textures, which are obtained from the Global Soil Dataset for Earth System Models, the SoilGrids product, and the Harmonized World Soil Database. Validations with existing S<sub>y</sub> values estimated by laboratory and field methods across different S<sub>y</sub> concepts, at the aquifer-scale to global-scale, compellingly revealed that the GASY effectively represents reliable average S<sub>y</sub> for each soil texture. The depth limitation (~2 m) of GASY is attributed to the depth limitations of soil texture data, and readers can expand the GASY into deeper soils by reasonably assuming a vertical variation of soil texture with depth. The GASY holds great benefits for future modeling of groundwater dynamics and understanding the groundwater resources distribution and mitigation of climate change impacts.,Scientific Data
Enhancing sub-seasonal soil moisture forecasts through land initialization,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00987-0,2025-03-12,We assess the relative contributions of land, atmosphere, and oceanic initializations to the forecast skill of root zone soil moisture (SM) utilizing the Community Earth System Model version 2 Sub to Seasonal climate forecast experiments (CESM2-S2S). Using eight sensitivity experiments, we disentangle the individual impacts of these three components and their interactions on the forecast skill for the contiguous United States. The CESM2-S2S experiment, in which land states are initialized while atmosphere and ocean remain in their climatological states, contributes 91 ± 3% of the total sub-seasonal forecast skill across varying soil moisture conditions during summer and winter. Most SM predictability stems from the soil moisture memory effect. Additionally, land-atmosphere coupling contributes 50% of the land-driven soil moisture predictability. A comparative analysis of the CESM2-S2S SM forecast skills against two other climate models highlights the potential for enhancing soil moisture forecast accuracy by improving the representation of soil moisture-precipitation feedback.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Groundwater quality evolution across China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57853-z,2025-03-14,China is facing a severe groundwater quality crisis amid economic development and climate change, yet the extent and trajectory of this crisis remain largely unknown. Here we developed a machine-learning model, incorporating natural and social-economic factors, to construct annual probabilistic maps of poor groundwater quality (PGQ, i.e., Class V based on the Chinese groundwater quality standard) across China from 1980 to 2100. Alarmingly, our findings indicate a concerning escalation in PGQ area ratio, rising from 17.3% in 1980 to 30.1% in 2000, and surging to 40.8% by 2020, adversely affecting 6.8%, 17.5%, and 36.0% of the Chinese population, respectively. The predominant drivers of this degradation were identified as agricultural discharge (contributing to 10.7% growth in PGQ area ratio), followed by groundwater exploitation (5.6%), industrial discharge (5.3%), domestic discharge (1.7%), climate change (0.5%), and land use change (-0.3%). By 2050, the PGQ area ratio could range from 37.9% to 48.3% under different socio-economic and climate scenarios. Our study highlights the urgent need for effective water resources management and conservation measures to mitigate the deteriorating trend of groundwater quality and address the challenges posed by socio-economic development and climate change, thereby safeguarding water security for China and the global community.,Nature Communications
Speleothem evidence of solar modulation on the south Asia monsoon intensity,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00971-8,2025-03-15,The influence of solar variation on climate has long been debated. Here, we utilize a decadal-resolved speleothem δ<sup>18</sup>O record from Vietnam, spanning 32.5 to 27.5 kyr BP, as a proxy for regional precipitation levels. Our results show a general coherence between Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) and regional precipitation, supporting a positive climate response consistent with conventional monsoon theory. Spectral analysis on studied datasets reveals an approximately 180-year periodicity coinciding with the de Vries cycle of solar activity. Further comparing our record with 35 other speleothem records, we demonstrate the importance of sufficient age control points in capturing solar-related periodicities. Model simulation shows that TSI could enhance monsoonal circulation and regional precipitation. Also highlighted are the implications of chronology control for detecting climate events in proxy records. The new findings underscore the significance of relatively minor radiative forcing in regional climate dynamics over monsoonal Asia on decadal to centennial timescales.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Ecological restoration in the Yellow River Basin enhances hydropower potential,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57891-7,2025-03-15,Hydropower, an important renewable energy source worldwide, is threatened by reservoir sedimentation. Ecological restoration (ER) can mitigate this by reducing upstream sediment, thereby extending hydropower facilities’ lifespan. However, ER may also reduce runoff, potentially diminishing energy generation and complicating its overall impact on hydropower potential. Here, we examine China’s Yellow River, once the world’s most sediment-laden river, using eco-hydrological and reservoir regulation models to assess how large-scale ER influences the hydropower potential of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir, which controls 92.3% of the basin area. Our results indicate that, excluding upstream reservoirs’ operations and socioeconomic water use, Xiaolangdi could generate a total of ~2.7×10<sup>11</sup> kWh of energy before facing diminished flexibility and efficiency caused by the exhaustion of sediment storage—57.3% more than without ER—equating to an additional ~100 billion kWh. This enhancement in hydropower potential primarily arises from the extended lifespan, despite a 6.9% reduction in average annual energy generation. These findings advance our understanding of the ecosystem-water-sediment-energy nexus, offering valuable insights for integrated watershed management globally.,Nature Communications
Shifting influences of Indian Ocean Dipole and western Pacific subtropical high on annual precipitation δ18O in southern East Asia,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01000-4,2025-03-17,Clarifying relationships between stable oxygen isotope ratios in precipitation (δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub>) and atmospheric circulations including the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) forms the basis of paleocirculation reconstructions. However, whether the IOD and WPSH modulate interannual variations of δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> remains unclear. Here, we reveal the links between the IOD/WPSH and the annual δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> in southern East Asia. We found that the IOD strongly influenced annual δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> before 1999 by changes in moisture supply from different transport pathways and convection. However, the link became decoupled after 1999, resulting from the transition of the IOD from a symmetric to an asymmetric pattern. In contrast, significantly enhanced WPSH emerges as an important influence on annual δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> after 1999. Therefore, the IOD and WPSH alternately influence interannual variation of δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> around 1999. Our findings imply that signals of IOD and WPSH should be considered in different periods to better interpret paleoclimate records.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Decreasing dynamic predictability of global agricultural drought with warming climate,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-025-02289-y,2025-03-17,Droughts have been occurring frequently worldwide in a warming climate with an adverse impact on water–food–energy–ecology security, which raises substantial challenges for drought predictability. However, little is known about the future changes in dynamic predictability of agricultural drought over the globe and the dominant confounders causing this change. Here we leveraged Bayesian model averaging ensemble vine copula model to reveal changes in agricultural drought predictability globally in warm seasons at three projected global warming levels. We found that the projected dynamic predictability of agricultural drought would significantly decrease over 70% of the global land areas in +2 °C and +3 °C worlds, especially over North America, Amazonia, Europe, eastern and southern Asia and Australia. This was primarily attributed to the weakening soil moisture memory, background aridity and weakening land–atmosphere coupling. Our findings highlight that stakeholders should employ dynamic climate adaptations to cope with the decreasing drought predictability in a warmer climate.,Nature Climate Change
Physical and biogeochemical responses of Tibetan Plateau lakes to climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-025-00650-5,2025-03-18,The lakes, rivers and glaciers of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) — a vital water resource for East Asia — are undergoing substantial environmental change. In this Review, we examine trends in the size and the physical and biogeochemical properties of TP lakes. Lake area and volume have consistently increased since 1995, with most rapid expansion in northern lakes. Between 1986 and 2022, the total area of lakes larger than 1 km<sup>2</sup> increased from 37,109 km<sup>2</sup> to 46,980 km<sup>2</sup>, and water storage increased by 169.7 km<sup>3</sup>, driven by warming and enhanced precipitation. In large lakes (≥10 km<sup>2</sup>), average surface temperatures increased by 1.33 °C, water transparency increased by 1 m, and salinity decreased from 48.76 to 23.76 psu. Responses in lake biogeochemistry include enhanced microbial diversity and trophic status, despite minimal additional nutrient inputs and consistent rates of productivity. Although TP lakes appear to be a net source of CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere (1.60, 6.87 and 1.16 Tg C yr<sup>−1</sup> in the 2000s, 2010s and the 2020s, respectively), long-term CO<sub>2</sub> source-sink dynamics remain uncertain. TP lake area is projected to increase by 9,000 km<sup>2</sup> by 2050 under SSP5-8.5 and will continue to influence and enhance regional precipitation. Improved prediction of TP lake hydrology and biogeochemistry will aid sustainable management of water resources across the TP.,Nature Reviews Earth & Environment
A spatially constrained remote sensing-based inventory of glacial lakes worldwide,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04809-z,2025-03-20,Climate change accelerates the extensive retreat of glaciers, leading to the widespread development of glacial lakes. A holistic picture of the spatial distribution of glacial lakes worldwide is a critical base for tracking the outburst hazards. By employing a semi-automated mapping approach and rigorous quality control, this study inventories 117,352 glacial lakes (≥0.01 km<sup>2</sup>) worldwide (the ice cap/sheet of Antarctic and Greenland excluded), with a net area of 24,755.84 ± 2,971.33 km<sup>2</sup>. The evaluation result shows this global inventory of glacial lakes (GIGLak) has an overall accuracy of 89.37% and 91.42% in number and area, respectively. These glacial lakes are widely distributed in different altitudes, ranging from the Earth’s third pole to the coasts. Most glacial lakes are distributed in the Greenland periphery, High-Mountain Asia, Alaska, Canada, and the Cordilleras. The number of glacial lakes between 0.01–0.1 km<sup>2</sup> accounts for 77.24% of the total count but only 11.82% in area. The classification of glacial lakes as four types indicates that the ice-uncontacted proglacial lakes dominate the number (67.07%) and area (53.04%) worldwide.,Scientific Data
Seasonal velocity patterns provide insights for the soft-bed subglacial hydrology continuum,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02198-0,2025-03-21,Subglacial hydrology plays an important role in controlling glacier behaviour, influencing glacier retreat and the resulting contributions to sea level rise. Here we present a detailed seasonal data set from four soft-bedded temperate glaciers and demonstrate a continuum of subglacial hydrology from channelized to a multichannel distributed behaviour. Our results illustrate how this continuum may be affected by till grain size and subaqueous processes, and we quantify the relative timings of basal sliding and deformation. These different hydrologies have a distinctive seasonal velocity pattern, which although have been identified using a multi-data stream, we suggest can be classified using solely Sentinel-1 satellite-based glacier velocity data. The ability to categorize subglacial glacier hydrology over a much larger data set would allow a better parameterization of subglacial processes for ice sheet models.,Communications Earth & Environment
An interpretable machine learning model for seasonal precipitation forecasting,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02207-2,2025-03-21,Seasonal climate forecasting is important for societal welfare, as it supports decision-makers in taking proactive steps to mitigate risks from adverse climate conditions or to take advantage of favorable ones. Here, we introduce TelNet, a sequence-to-sequence machine learning model for short-to-medium lead seasonal precipitation forecasting. The model takes past seasonal precipitation values and climate indices to predict an empirical precipitation distribution for every grid point of the target region for the next six overlapping seasons. TelNet has a simple encoder-decoder-head architecture, allowing the model to be trained with a limited amount of data, as is often the case in climate forecasting. Its deterministic and probabilistic performance is thoroughly evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art dynamical and deep learning models in a prominent region for seasonal forecasting studies due to its high climate predictability. The training, validation, and test sets are resampled multiple times to estimate the uncertainty associated with a small dataset. The results show that TelNet ranks among the most accurate and calibrated models across multiple initialization months and lead times, especially during the rainy season when the predictable signal is strongest. Moreover, the model allows instance- and lead-wise forecast interpretation through its variable selection weights.,Communications Earth & Environment
Prolonged water body types dataset of urban agglomeration in central China from 1990 to 2021,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04794-3,2025-03-22,Data and knowledge of spatial-temporal dynamics of multiple types of water body are significant for water resources management but remain very limited. Using the Landsat satellite data and weakly supervised deep learning techniques for long term mapping, we report annual maps of multiple types of inland water bodies on urban agglomeration scale in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (MRYR) during 1990-2021 at 30m spatial resolution. Accuracy assessment from 14000 validation points in seven years indicates an overall accuracy of 94.50%. Quantitative and qualitative comparison with other water related mapping products further demonstrates the superiority on long time span, refined classification system, and the high precision. The Water-MRYR could support the government and the public in the challenging water resources management and wetland conservation.,Scientific Data
100-m-resolution surface soil moisture data during the thawing season on the Qinghai‒Tibet Plateau,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04831-1,2025-03-24,The characteristics of the spatial distribution of surface soil moisture (SM) on the Qinghai‒Tibet Plateau (QTP) on a fine scale are unclear due to the lack of high-spatial-resolution SM datasets. To improve this situation, we first supplemented 659 SM datasets in areas on the QTP containing sparse monitoring stations from 2021–2022 and integrated published SM datasets. Based on Sentinel-1&amp;2 and measured SM data, we developed an SM retrieval algorithm for the ascending and descending orbits. Then, 100-m-resolution SM spatial data were generated for the thawing season of 2017–2023 in the SAR signal-applicable area on the QTP. As validated by the measured data, the correlation coefficients of the retrieval results for the ascending and descending orbits were 0.72 and 0.69, respectively, and the bias reached 0.07 m³/m³ and an RMSE of 0.07 m³/m³ for both. These SM datasets exhibit notable promise for improving our understanding and analysis of the ecology and hydrology of different environments on the QTP.,Scientific Data
Machine learning shows a limit to rain-snow partitioning accuracy when using near-surface meteorology,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58234-2,2025-03-25,Partitioning precipitation into rain and snow with near-surface meteorology is a well-known challenge. However, whether a limit exists to its potential performance remains unknown. Here, we evaluate this possibility by applying a set of benchmark precipitation phase partitioning methods plus three machine learning (ML) models (an artificial neural network, random forest, and XGBoost) to two independent datasets: 38.5 thousand crowdsourced observations and 17.8 million synoptic meteorology reports. The ML methods provide negligible improvements over the best benchmarks, increasing accuracy only by up to 0.6% and reducing rain and snow biases by up to -4.7%. ML methods fail to identify mixed precipitation and sub-freezing rainfall events, while expressing their worst accuracy values from 1.0 °C–2.5 °C. A potential cause of these shortcomings is the air temperature overlap in rain and snow distributions (peaking between 1.0 °C–1.6 °C), which expresses a significant negative relationship (p &lt; 0.0005) with partitioning accuracy. Thus, the meteorological characteristics of rain and snow are similar at air temperatures slightly above freezing with increasing overlap associated with decreasing performance. We suggest researchers switch their focus from marginally improving inherently limited precipitation phase partitioning methods using near-surface meteorology to creating new methods that assimilate novel data sources—e.g., crowdsourced precipitation phase observations.,Nature Communications
Freshwater inflows to closed basins of the Andean plateau in Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02130-6,2025-03-26,More than half the world’s lithium resources are found in brine aquifers in Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia. Lithium brine processing requires freshwater, so as lithium exploration increases, accurate estimates of freshwater availability are critical for water management decisions in this region with limited water resources. Here we calculate modern freshwater inflows, such as groundwater recharge and streamflow, for 28 active or prospective lithium-producing basins. We use regional water budget assessments, field streamflow measurements, and global climate and groundwater recharge datasets. Using the freshwater inflow estimates, we calculate water scarcity using the Available Water Remaining methodology. Among all 28 basins, freshwater inflows range from 2 to 33 mm year<sup>−1</sup>. Our results reveal that commonly used global hydrologic models overestimate streamflow and freshwater availability substantially, leading to inaccurate water scarcity classifications.,Communications Earth & Environment
A pronounced decline in northern vegetation resistance to flash droughts from 2001 to 2022,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58253-z,2025-03-27,Climate change has led to the transition of droughts into rapid and intensified phenomena known as flash droughts, presenting considerable challenges for risk management, particularly concerning their impact on ecosystem productivity. Quantifying the ecosystem’s capacity to maintain productivity during flash droughts, referred to as ecosystem resistance, is crucial to assess drought impacts. However, it remains uncertain how the resistance of ecosystem productivity to flash drought changes over time. Here we show that vegetation resistance to flash droughts declines by up to 27% (±5%) over the Northern Hemisphere hotspots during 2001-2022, including eastern Asia, western North America, and northern Europe. The notable decline in vegetation resistance is mainly attributed to increased vapour pressure deficit and temperature, and enhanced vegetation structural sensitivity to water availability. Flash droughts pose higher ecological risks than slowly-developing droughts during the growing seasons, where ecosystem productivity experiences faster decline rates with a shorter response time. Our results underscore the limited ecosystem capacity to resist flash droughts under climate change.,Nature Communications
Dynamics of intensification of extreme precipitation events over the Arabian Peninsula derived from CMIP6 simulations,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01016-w,2025-03-28,This study derives historical and future changes in extreme precipitation events (EPEs) across the Arabian Peninsula (AP) using data from CMIP6 models. Both the frequency and intensity of EPEs are lower in historical CMIP6 data compared to observations. Despite this bias, CMIP6 models offer valuable insights into future climate projections. Across all emission-scenarios, significant increases in EPEs frequency and intensity are expected over the AP. Under the high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5), some regions may experience a doubling of EPEs by the end-of-the-21st-century. This rise is attributed to several climate change-driven factors, including the southward-shift and intensification of subtropical-westerly-jet, increased transient activity, enhanced dynamical lifting, and increased moisture transport from nearby seas. These factors suggest a future atmosphere that will be more dynamic and moisture-rich than today. While these CMIP6 insights are crucial for guiding adaptation and mitigation strategies, enhanced EPE modeling is essential for precise decision-making amid rising future risks.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Interdecadal variability of terrestrial water storage since 2003,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02203-6,2025-03-29,Earth’s water cycle is changing due to anthropogenic forcing and internal variations in the climate system. These changes are leading to an intensification of the water cycle that manifests as more frequent and stronger droughts in some areas, and pluvials in others. The resulting impacts on terrestrial water storage can be crucial for water availability. However, current understanding is hampered by limitations in observations and models, and the variety of processes that influence terrestrial water storage across temporal scales. Here, we leverage the now two-decades long satellite record from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment and subsequent Follow-On missions to investigate persistent trends in the presence of internal variability. We use cyclostationary empirical orthogonal function analysis to uncover statistical modes of variability that help explain a shift in decadal terrestrial water storage trends that occurred around 2012. The dominant statistical mode suggests an interdecadal periodicity that is also found in the precipitation record. The second leading mode is highly correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Isolating these modes points to regions where the magnitude of the terrestrial water storage trend may flatten or reverse in coming decades due to internal climate variability and reduces uncertainty in multidecadal linear trends.,Communications Earth & Environment
Divergent effects of temperature and precipitation on water flow into the largest lake on the Tibetan Plateau,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01017-9,2025-03-30,The majority of lakes on the TP have expanded in an accelerated manner, changing the regulation of local water cycles and ecosystems. Here, spatiotemporal changes in inflow to Selin Co (the largest lake on the TP) from 1979 to 2022 were modeled, and the impacts of warming and wetting on water volume were explored. The modeled annual mean lake inflow was 2.27 km<sup>3</sup>, accompanied by a significant growth trend of 0.035 km<sup>3</sup>/yr (p &lt; 0.01, the contributions of warming and wetting are −0.016 and 0.048 km<sup>3</sup>/yr respectively). Warming (+0.0386 K/yr) caused a decrease of 0.33 km<sup>3</sup> in lake inflow per year, accounting for 14.5% of the annual mean water volume, while wetting (+4.46 mm/yr) caused an increase of 0.91 km<sup>3</sup> in lake inflow per year, accounting for 40% of the annual mean value. These divergent effects of increasing temperature and precipitation on lake inflow makes it more difficult to predict the future water resources of basins such as Selin Co.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Global patterns in observed hydrologic processes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-025-00407-w,2025-03-31,To manage water resources and forecast river flows, hydrologists seek to understand how water moves from precipitation, through watersheds, into river channels. However, we lack fundamental information on the spatial distribution and physical controls on global hydrologic processes. This information is needed to provide theoretical support for large-domain model simulations. Here, to address this issue, we present a global, searchable database of 400 research watersheds with published descriptions of dominant hydrologic flow pathways. This knowledge synthesis approach leverages decades of grant funding, fieldwork effort and local expertise. We use the database to test longstanding hypotheses about the roles of climate, biomes and landforms in controlling hydrologic processes. We show that aridity predicts the depth of water flow pathways and that terrain and biomes predict the prevalence of lateral flow pathways. These new data and search capabilities support efficient hypothesis testing to investigate emergent patterns that relate landscape organization to hydrologic function.,Nature Water
A unified ensemble soil moisture dataset across the continental United States,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04657-x,2025-04-01,A unified ensemble soil moisture (SM) package has been developed over the Continental United States (CONUS). The data package includes 19 products from land surface models, remote sensing, reanalysis, and machine learning models. All datasets are unified to a 0.25-degree and monthly spatiotemporal resolution, providing a comprehensive view of surface SM dynamics. The statistical analysis of the datasets leverages the Koppen-Geiger Climate Classification to explore surface SM’s spatiotemporal variabilities. The extracted SM characteristics highlight distinct patterns, with the western CONUS showing larger coefficient of variation values and the eastern CONUS exhibiting higher SM values. Remote sensing datasets tend to be drier, while reanalysis products present wetter conditions. In-situ SM observations serve as the basis for wavelet power spectrum analyses to explain discrepancies in temporal scales across datasets facilitating daily SM records. This study provides a comprehensive soil moisture data package and an analysis framework that can be used for Earth system model evaluations and uncertainty quantification, quantifying drought impacts and land–atmosphere interactions and making recommendations for drought response planning.,Scientific Data
FAIR-Compliant Database for Soil Erosion Studies: The Marganai Forest Experiment,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04797-0,2025-04-02,The ‘2018 Marganai Forest Soil Erosion Experiment Database’ is a comprehensive collection of measures taken during scientific experiment trials designed to investigate the effects of forest canopy coverage on soil erosion under intense artificial rainfall, four years after coppicing. The investigation involved the establishment of eight paired plots with and without forest canopy coverage, subjected to artificial rainfall simulation aimed to measure the amount of sediment transported by runoff. The work represents a valuable resource for researchers interested in understanding the complex implications of forest management practices on soil erosion. The paper, produced using Quarto in a Gitlab-based RStudio project, is an example of ‘reproducible research’ documenting that the database provides detailed information on the experimental setup as well as on the range of different measurements that have been collected. The database, produced using NFS-DataDocumentationProcedure, is stored in an SQLite file, extensively exploiting the relational properties of the engine, enhancing data accessibility, interoperability and reusability.,Scientific Data
Drivers and impacts of sediment deposition in Amazonian floodplains,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57495-1,2025-04-02,The Amazon River carries enormous amounts of sediment from the Andes mountains, much of which is deposited in its floodplains. However, accurate quantification of the sediment sink at fine spatiotemporal scales is still challenging. Here, we present a high-resolution hydrodynamic-sediment model to simulate sediment deposition in a representative Amazon/Solimões floodplain. The process is found to be jointly driven by inundation, suspended sediment concentration in the Amazon River, and floodplain hydrodynamics and only weakly correlated with inundation level. By upscaling the sediment deposition rate (1.33 ± 0.24 kg m<sup>−2</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>), we estimate the trapping of 77.3 ± 13.9 Mt (or 6.1 ± 1%) of the Amazon River sediment by the Amazon/Solimões floodplains every year. Widespread deforestation would reduce the trapping efficiency of the floodplains over time, exacerbating downstream river aggradation. Additionally, we show that the deposition of sediment-associated organic carbon plays a minor role in fueling carbon dioxide and methane emissions in the Amazon.,Nature Communications
Monsoonal imprint on late Quaternary landscapes of the Rub’ al Khali Desert,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02224-1,2025-04-03,Abundant geomorphological, biological, and isotopic records show that Arabia repeatedly underwent significant climate-driven environmental changes during late Quaternary humid periods. Precisely mapping how the enhancement and expansion of the African Monsoon during these humid periods have affected landscape evolution and human occupation dynamics in Arabia remains a scientific challenge. Here we reconstruct an ancient water-sculpted landscape consisting of lake and river deposits, coupled with a large outlet valley in the Rub’ al Khali Desert of Saudi Arabia. During the peak of the Holocene Humid Period or before, intense rainfall reactivated alluvial floodplains and filled a ~1100 km² topographic depression, which eventually breached, carving a deep ~150 km-long valley. Coupling geologic reconstructions with transient Earth system model simulations shows that this hydrological activity was linked to higher seasonal precipitation punctuated by repeated heavy events. Analysis of lacustrine and fluvial sedimentary deposits implies sediment routing across distances of up to 1000 km from the Asir Mountains. Our results indicate that such intense flooding challenges the conventional view of simple, weak, and linear landscape stabilization following increased rainfall in Arabia. Our findings highlight the crucial role of an enhanced African Monsoon in driving rapid landscape transformations in the Arabian Desert.,Communications Earth & Environment
Giant iceberg meltwater increases upper-ocean stratification and vertical mixing,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-025-01659-7,2025-04-04,Ice-sheet mass loss is one of the clearest manifestations of climate change, with Antarctica discharging mass into the ocean via melting or through calving. The latter produces icebergs that can modify ocean water properties, often at great distances from source. This affects upper-ocean physics and primary productivity, with implications for atmospheric carbon drawdown. A detailed understanding of iceberg modification of ocean waters has hitherto been hindered by a lack of proximal measurements. Here unique measurements of a giant iceberg from an underwater glider enable quantification of meltwater effects on the physical and biological processes in the upper layers of the Southern Ocean, a region disproportionately important for global heat and carbon sequestration. Iceberg basal melting erodes seasonally produced winter water layer stratification, normally forming a strong potential energy barrier to vertical exchange of surface and deep waters, while freshwater run-off increases and shoals near-surface stratification. Nutrient-rich deeper waters, incorporating meltwater loaded with terrigenous material, are ventilated to below this stratification maxima, providing a potential mechanism for alleviating critical phytoplankton-limiting components. Regional historical hydrographic data demonstrate similar stratification changes during the passage of another large iceberg, suggesting that they may be an important pathway of aseasonal winter water modification.,Nature Geoscience
High Resolution Water Quality Dataset of Chinese Lakes and Reservoirs from 2000 to 2023,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04915-y,2025-04-04,Water quality parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), total nitrogen (TN, includes both organic nitrogen and inorganic nitrogen), total phosphorus (TP), permanganate index (COD<sub>Mn</sub>), turbidity (Tur), electrical conductivity (EC), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)) are important to evaluate the ecological health of lakes and reservoirs. In this research, we developed a monthly dataset of these key water quality parameters from 2000 to 2023 for nearly 180,000 lakes and reservoirs across China, using the random forest (RF) models. These RF models took into account the impacts of climate, soil properties, and anthropogenic activities within basins of studied lakes and reservoirs, and effectively captured the spatial and temporal variations of their water quality parameters with correlation coefficients (R<sup>2</sup>) ranging from 0.65 to 0.76. Interestingly, an increase in Tur and EC was observed during this period, while pH, DO, and other parameters showed minimal fluctuations. This dataset is of significant value for further evaluating the ecological, environmental, and climatic functions of aquatic ecosystems.,Scientific Data
A 20-year dataset (2001–2020) of global cropland water-use efficiency at 1-km grid resolution,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04904-1,2025-04-04,Cropland water-use efficiency (WUE) is an essential indicator for the sustainable utilization of agricultural water resources. The lack of long-term global cropland WUE datasets with high spatial resolution limits our understanding of global and regional patterns of cropland WUE. This study developed a long-term global cropland WUE dataset at 1-km spatial resolution from 2001 to 2020. The cropland WUE was obtained as the ratio between net primary productivity (NPP) and evapotranspiration that was retrieved from ETMonitor global evapotranspiration datasets. The global cropland NPP was estimated by subtracting plant respiration from gross primary production (GPP), which was estimated using an improved light-use efficiency model after being optimized for different global climate zones using flux-tower observation data. The generated WUE product showed good accuracy with high correlation efficiency (0.76) and low root mean square error (0.5 g C/kg H<sub>2</sub>O/yr) compared with the ground measurements at flux towers. This dataset can be used as fundamental data to advance the efficient utilization of water use for sustainable development.,Scientific Data
Big data show idiosyncratic patterns and rates of geomorphic river mobility,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58427-9,2025-04-05,Big data present unprecedented opportunities to test long-standing theories regarding patterns and rates of geomorphic river adjustments. Here, we use locational probabilities derived from Landsat imagery (1988-2019) to quantify the dynamics of 600 km<sup>2</sup> of riverbed in 10 Philippine catchments. Analysis of lateral adjustments reveals spatially non-uniform variability in along-valley patterns of geomorphic river mobility, with zones of relative stability interspersed with zones of relative instability. Hotspots of mobility vary in magnitude, size and location between catchments. We could not identify monotonic relationships between local factors (active channel width, valley floor width and confinement ratio) and mobility. No relation between the channel pattern type and rates of adjustment was evident. We contend that satellite-derived locational probabilities provide a spatially continuous dynamic metric that can help unravel and contextualise forms and rates of geomorphic river adjustment, thereby helping to derive insights into idiosyncrasies of river behaviour in dynamic landscapes.,Nature Communications
Tracking grid-level freshwater boundary exceedance along global supply chains from consumption to impact,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-025-00420-z,2025-04-07,Consumption behaviours exert pressure on water resources both locally and globally through interconnected supply chains, hindering the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals 6 (Clean water and sanitation) and 12 (Responsible consumption and production). However, it is challenging to link hotspots of water depletion across spatial scales to final consumption while reflecting intersectoral competition for water. In this study, we estimated the global exceedance of regional freshwater boundaries (RFBs) due to human water withdrawal at a 5-arcmin grid scale using 2015 data, enabling the identification of hotspots across different spatial scales. To reduce uncertainty, we used average estimates from 15 global hydrological models and 5 environmental flow requirement methods. We further attributed the hotspots of exceedance to final consumption across 245 economies and 134 sectors via the multi-region input–output model EMERGING. Our refined framework revealed previously unknown connections between regional hotspots and consumption through international trade. Notably, we found that 24% of grid-level RFB exceedance (718 km<sup>3</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>; 95% confidence interval of 659–776 km<sup>3</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>) was outsourced through trade, with the largest flows (52 km<sup>3</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>; 95% confidence interval of 47–56 km<sup>3</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>) from water-stressed South and Central Asia to arid West Asia. The demand for cereals and other agricultural products dominated global consumption-based RFB exceedance (29%), while the exports of textiles and machinery and equipment exacerbated territorial exceedance in manufacturing hubs within emerging economies. Our methodology facilitates the tracing of global hotspots of water scarcity along supply chains and the assignment of responsibilities at finer scales.,Nature Water
Subglacial water amplifies Antarctic contributions to sea-level rise,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58375-4,2025-04-07,Antarctica’s contribution to global sea-level rise is deeply uncertain, with subglacial water suspected to play a critical role, yet its impact remains unclear. We demonstrate that water at the base of ice sheets influences sliding behaviour and that its exclusion from models can underestimate sea-level rise projections and delay the predicted onset of tipping points. Here we use an Antarctic Ice Sheet model (Elmer/Ice) to explore how different assumptions about water pressure at the ice base affect sea-level rise projections from 2015 to 2300. Our results indicate that incorporating subglacial water can amplify ice discharge across the Antarctic Ice Sheet by up to threefold above the standard approach, potentially contributing an additional 2.2 metres to sea-level rise by 2300. Notably, a smoothly decreasing basal drag near the grounding line more than doubles grounding line flux by 2300 relative to scenarios where effective pressure is simplified into a spatially constant coefficient. Basin-specific responses vary significantly, with some scenarios advancing tipping points by up to 40 years. These findings underscore the critical need to integrate evolving subglacial hydrology into ice sheet models.,Nature Communications
A global near real-time dataset of Microwave Integrated Drought Index from the Fengyun-3 satellites,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04935-8,2025-04-07,Droughts have become more frequent and intense with increasing climate warming, posing widespread risks on ecosystem, agricultural, and water resources, therefore effective and timely drought monitoring is critical to drought assessment, management, and mitigation. Here, we presented a global monthly and ten-day drought dataset of the Fengyun-3 Microwave Integrated Drought Index (FY-3 MIDI) by integrating the inconsistency corrected FY-3B/C/D derived microwave precipitation, soil moisture, and land surface temperature with optimal weights from June 2014 to present. The dataset was evaluated and validated against the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, the Self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index, and the non-FY MIDI at 0.25°. The FY-3 MIDI can effectively observe drought condition and characteristics as captured by the reference datasets, and it was reliable in monitoring meteorological drought with the ability to work in all-weather condition. Based on the operational Fengyun-3 series satellite, it provided valuable operational service in near real-time on a monthly and ten-day time scale, guaranteeing present and future continuous applications to support global and regional drought monitoring and assessment.,Scientific Data
Rapid decline of Caspian Sea level threatens ecosystem integrity, biodiversity protection, and human infrastructure,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02212-5,2025-04-10,The Caspian Sea is the world’s largest landlocked waterbody, providing habitat for hundreds of endemic and migratory species, along with ecosystem services that sustain millions of people. Global warming is projected to drive declines in water levels of up to 21 m by 2100. Using geospatial analyses, we assessed the impact of sea level decline on habitats, protected areas, and human infrastructure. We show that a water level decline of just 5–10 m will critically disrupt key ecosystems (including habitats for endemic Caspian seals and sturgeon), reduce existing marine protected area coverage by up to 94%, and render billions of dollars of civil and industrial infrastructure obsolete. Replacing traditional static conservation planning with a pre-emptive, dynamic approach that allows protected areas to track shifting ecosystems, is recommended to help endemic Caspian Sea biodiversity adapt to these changes, and to avoid conflicts with mitigation efforts directed at protecting human activities.,Communications Earth & Environment
Observational evidence of increased afternoon rainfall downwind of irrigated areas,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58729-y,2025-04-10,Irrigation plays a vital role in addressing the growing food demand of an increasing global population. It represents one of the most critical and direct human interventions on the coupled water and energy cycles. As irrigated farmland continues to expand, understanding the climate impact of extensive irrigation becomes increasingly important. Yet, the effect on rainfall patterns near irrigated areas remains unclear. Here, using two global, high-resolution, sub-daily precipitation datasets, we show that afternoon rain events occur more often 10 km to 50 km downwind and less often upwind of extensively irrigated land. However, we also find that the total amount of heavy afternoon rain downwind of irrigated areas is lower than upwind. Our results establish large-scale observational evidence of the local precipitation dynamics surrounding irrigated areas; these insights will help constrain the representation of these processes in next-generation climate and weather forecasting models and provide valuable insights for regional water management.,Nature Communications
Subsurface heatwaves in lakes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-025-02314-0,2025-04-10,Lake heatwaves (extreme hot water events) can substantially disrupt aquatic ecosystems. Although surface heatwaves are well studied, their vertical structures within lakes remain largely unexplored. Here we analyse the characteristics of subsurface lake heatwaves (extreme hot events occurring below the surface) using a spatiotemporal modelling framework. Our findings reveal that subsurface heatwaves are frequent, often longer lasting but less intense than surface events. Deep-water heatwaves (bottom heatwaves) have increased in frequency (7.2 days decade<sup>−1</sup>), duration (2.1 days decade<sup>−1</sup>) and intensity (0.2 °C days decade<sup>−1</sup>) over the past 40 years. Moreover, vertically compounding heatwaves, where extreme heat occurs simultaneously at the surface and bottom, have risen by 3.3 days decade<sup>−1</sup>. By the end of the century, changes in heatwave patterns, particularly under high emissions, are projected to intensify. These findings highlight the need for subsurface monitoring to fully understand and predict the ecological impacts of lake heatwaves.,Nature Climate Change
Monthly 0.05° winter months snow depth dataset for the Northern Hemisphere from 21 CMIP6 models,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04925-w,2025-04-10,Accurate snow depth datasets are crucial for water resource management, comprehensive climate change evaluations, and the sustainable advancement of the ice-and-snow economy in the context of rapid climate change. To create a high-resolution monthly snow depth dataset tailored for the Northern Hemisphere winter months (NHMSD), this study employed the Delta statistical downscaling method, in conjunction with a spatial feature transfer technique, to refine snow depth data derived from 21 major general circulation models and four shared socioeconomic pathways sourced from the CMIP6 project. The NHMSD stands as the world’s pioneering long-term 0.05° snow depth dataset, encompassing the historical era from 1980 to 2014 and extending into future projections from 2015 to 2100. Validation using 2062 ground snow depth observations has confirmed that NHMSD outperforms reanalysis datasets, including ERA5-Land and GLDAS, in terms of root mean square error, bias, and mean absolute error for the periods 1980–2014 and 2015–2023. This dataset facilitates the exploration of potential alterations in snow depth under future scenarios in the Northern Hemisphere.,Scientific Data
Atmospheric drought indices in future projections,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-025-00416-9,2025-04-11,In this Perspective we critically discuss future drought projections, focusing on key issues related to the concept of drought and its frequent confusion with aridity. We address the common misunderstanding between drought metrics and drought indices, as well as misconceptions about what drought indices represent. Our analysis emphasizes the role of atmospheric evaporative demand in shaping future drought severity, along with its drivers, impact processes, and responses to global warming, while highlighting related observational and theoretical challenges. We also shed light on the uncertainties and limitations of Earth system models (ESMs) in assessing future drought severity. We explore the complexities of ESMs in accurately representing plant physiological and hydrological processes, which are crucial for evaluating drought severity. Our discussion also delves into the nuanced effects of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations on these processes and on water dynamics within ESMs, helping to clarify conceptual issues related to atmospheric drought indices. Finally, we advocate for a balanced evaluation of drought metrics, emphasizing the importance of considering multiple atmospheric processes in drought projections.,Nature Water
ERA5–Drought: Global drought indices based on ECMWF reanalysis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04896-y,2025-04-14,Droughts are increasingly intensified by human-induced climate change and pose a growing threat to society. Thus, enhancing our capabilities to monitor drought occurrence and intensity is crucial. This paper introduces a new dataset of drought indices derived from the 5th generation ECMWF reanalysis system (ERA5), which offers long-term monitoring of the global climate in both deterministic and probabilistic forms. This global dataset is freely accessible through an ECMWF-hosted data store, and it entails two prominent drought indices: the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). Both indices are calculated over a range of accumulation periods from 1 month to 4 years and are available for the full ERA5 climatology from 1940 to today. It also contains validation data that indicates the quality of these drought indices. The ERA5–Drought dataset serves as a valuable tool for environmental agencies and supports sectors such as water management and agriculture, thus contributing to efforts that monitor water and food security.,Scientific Data
Patterns and drivers of Holocene moisture variability in mid-latitude eastern North America,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58685-7,2025-04-15,Proxy data for eastern North American hydroclimate indicate strong and persistent multi-millennial droughts during the Holocene, but climate model simulations often fail to reproduce the proxy-inferred droughts. Diagnosing the data–model mismatch can offer valuable insights about the drivers of hydrological variability and different regional sensitivities to hydroclimate forcing. Here we present a proxy–modeling synthesis for Holocene climates in the eastern North American mid-latitudes, including machine-learning-based water balance reconstructions and high-resolution climate simulations. These data-model results resolve prior-generation inconsistencies, show consistent spatiotemporal patterns of Holocene hydroclimate change, and enable assessment of the driving mechanisms. This agreement suggests that the secular summer insolation trend, combined with the Laurentide Ice Sheet deglaciation and its effect on atmospheric circulation, together explain the extent and duration of drier-than-present climates. In addition, our high-resolution proxy data and transient simulations reveal clear multi-centennial climate variability. In our simulations, temperature-driven increases in evapotranspiration exceed regional precipitation gains, drying much of the region during the mid Holocene. This suggests that the mid-Holocene multi-millennial drought was driven by similar processes compared to the drying trajectory projected for mid-latitude North America over this century, which is also primarily driven by warming.,Nature Communications
Cell-scale atmospheric moisture flows dataset reconciled with ERA5 reanalysis,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04964-3,2025-04-15,Water vapour flows in the atmosphere are fundamental to the hydrological cycle, linking evaporation sources to precipitation sinks. Recent atmospheric tracking models have provided valuable insights, allowing one to trace the sources of precipitation and determine where evaporated water from specific regions will eventually precipitate. Despite improvements in model accuracy, there remain significant discrepancies between reconstructed and observed evaporation and precipitation data from reanalysis. To address these discrepancies and enhance the reliability of tracking models’ estimates, we propose a procedure based on Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF). Using this approach, we reconcile atmospheric moisture flows reconstructed by the Lagrangian model UTrack with ERA5 reanalysis data. This ensures that the traced atmospheric water matches the total evaporation and the precipitation annually. The reconciled bilateral connections provide a new dataset (RECON) centred on the period 2008-2017 that facilitates the exploration of atmospheric vapour flows between evaporation and precipitation basins at the global scale with a spatial resolution of 0.5°. Further, the proposed framework applies to any cell-scale dataset of atmospheric moisture tracking.,Scientific Data
Recent intensified riverine CO2 emission across the Northern Hemisphere permafrost region,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58716-3,2025-04-16,Global warming causes permafrost thawing, transferring large amounts of soil carbon into rivers, which inevitably accelerates riverine CO<sub>2</sub> release. However, temporally and spatially explicit variations of riverine CO<sub>2</sub> emissions remain unclear, limiting the assessment of land carbon-climate feedback. Using new and published 5685 riverine CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure data in the Arctic and Tibetan Plateau, we show that current riverine CO<sub>2</sub> emission across the Northern Hemisphere permafrost zone is 200 ± 15 Tg C yr⁻<sup>1</sup>. The emission offsets 28.1 ± 2.1% of the land carbon uptake in the Northern Hemisphere permafrost zone, with large regional variability of 13.1 to 63.1%. Our findings suggest that CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increased at a rate of 0.42 ± 0.16 Tg C yr⁻<sup>1</sup> during 2000 to 2020, and this is primarily driven by increased precipitation and accelerated permafrost thawing under climate change. This study highlights increased riverine carbon emission and strengthening of the permafrost carbon feedback to climate after incorporating carbon release from rivers.,Nature Communications
Increasing probability of extreme rainfall preconditioned by humid heatwaves in global coastal megacities,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-01023-x,2025-04-16,Hot–wet compound events, the sequential occurrence of humid hot days followed by extreme rainfall, can cause catastrophic consequences, often exceeding the impacts of the isolated occurrence of each event. The urban-coastal microclimate is confounded by complex interactions of land–sea breeze circulations, urban effects of convection and rainfall, and horizontal advection of moisture, which can favor the hot–wet compound occurrence. We present the first observational assessment (1951–2022) of summertime hot–wet compound events across global coastal megacities. We find a significant (P &lt; 0.001) increase in the frequency of hot–wet compound events in both hemispheres: on average, ~3 events in the 1950s to 43 events in the 2020s. Cities with upward trends in the frequency of hot–wet compound events are situated &lt; 30 km from coasts, with cities in the southern hemisphere showing faster hot-to-wet transition times (&lt;3 days) than cities in the northern hemisphere. Further, 26 out of 29 sites show increased extreme precipitation, reaching 153%, when humid heat amplitude rises from the 50th to 90th percentiles. Understanding hot–wet compound interactions over the world’s coasts is highly relevant for climate change impact assessment and informing climate adaptation.,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Global dataset combining open-source hydropower plant and reservoir data,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04975-0,2025-04-17,Hydropower is a crucial renewable source that depends heavily on water availability. Analyzing drought and climate change impacts on hydropower potential requires detailed data on both hydropower plant attributes (e.g. plant type and head) and reservoir characteristics (e.g. area, depth and volume). However, existing open-source datasets are poorly integrated: hydropower plant datasets often lack reservoir information, while reservoir datasets commonly miss hydropower plant information. This paper addresses this gap by introducing GloHydroRes, a global dataset that combines existing open-source hydropower plant and reservoir datasets. GloHydroRes includes attributes like plant location, head, plant type as well as reservoir details such as dam and reservoir location, dam height, reservoir depth, area, and volume for 7,775 plants in 128 countries. GloHydroRes covers nearly 79% and 81% of the global installed capacity when compared with installed hydropower data as reported by the EIA(2022) and IRENA (2023), respectively. The open-source GloHydroRes dataset provides crucial data to improve hydropower generation modelling at plant level and can support energy security and planning at continent to global scale.,Scientific Data
Water-saving irrigated area expansion hardly enhances crop yield while saving water under climate scenarios in China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02279-0,2025-04-17,Facing climate change risks of water shortages and crop yield losses, it is unclear in China that whether and how irrigated area expansion and technological yield improvement can increase production with less water. Here we used 2000–2018 as the baseline and simulated the grid responses of total crop water use, production, unit water footprint by cropping modes in 2030s–2090 s in 75 scenarios with considering each 5 levels of two adaptation measures under 3 climate change pathways. Compared with climate change alone, further irrigation expansion has limited effects on increasing production (below 20.8%) and decreasing water footprint (below 3.6%). Combined two adaptation measures magnifies their respective effects, with technological yield improvement dominating contributions to production (37.0–99.6%) and water footprint (90.4–102.3%). In comprehensive optimal scenario, water footprint will reduce with increased production. No water is saved with reduced green water (1.6–1.7%) and increased blue water (6.6–21.6%).,Communications Earth & Environment
Enhanced flood synchrony and downstream severity in the Delaware River under rising temperatures,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02243-y,2025-04-17,River floods threaten life and economic stability, with risks increasing globally, especially in densely populated coastal areas. In mountainous coastal watersheds like the Delaware River Basin, rising temperature is projected to reduce snowpack, reshaping upstream–downstream flood dynamics. However, the impact on flood synchronization between upland tributaries and estuarine mainstems remains poorly understood. Using multidecadal streamflow simulations from a high-resolution hydrological model, we find significant increases in the frequency and magnitude of synchronized floods under future warming scenarios, particularly severe floods (above the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile). Under higher warming scenarios, snowpack and rain-on-snow floods in headwater subbasins nearly vanish. Surprisingly, this regime shift amplifies estuarine flooding by enhancing synchronization between historically snow-dominated subbasins and their downstream counterparts. Despite intensified synchronization and flood magnitude, cold-season flood risk declines due to fewer rain-on-snow events. Conversely, summer floods grow larger, more frequent, and synchronized, driving a seasonal reconfiguration of flood risk that should be considered in future mitigation strategies.,Communications Earth & Environment
Warming leads to both earlier and later snowmelt floods over the past 70 years,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58832-0,2025-04-17,Climate warming reduces snow cover in cold regions, altering snowmelt flood regimes with significant hydrological and ecological consequences. Existing evidence indicates that as climate warms, snowmelt tends to begin earlier in the season, leading to earlier snowmelt floods. Here we show that the timing of snowmelt floods can be either advanced or delayed under warming. Using streamflow observations from 1950–2020 and an event-based analysis that distinguishes flood-generating mechanisms across 2339 Northern Hemisphere, snow-affected catchments, we show that the earlier snowmelt effect can be substantially offset or even reversed by a decelerated snowmelt rate under warming. This results in delayed snowmelt floods in approximately 30% of the catchments, contributing to an overall minor shift on a hemispheric scale (−0.87 ± 2.4 days per decade). Our findings challenge the prevailing “warming leads to earlier snowmelt floods” paradigm, revealing a more complex pattern of changes in snowmelt flood in a warming world.,Nature Communications
Assessing the consistent and divergent impacts of urbanization on heavy rainfall in Chinese urban agglomerations,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02283-4,2025-04-18,Understanding the impact of urbanization on extreme precipitation is crucial for promoting sustainable urban development in the context of global warming and rapid urban expansion. Here we found the highest impacts in humid regions such as the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta, where urbanization amplifies extreme rainfall intensities, varying with the rate of urbanization across the representative cities. Moreover, the impact is greater at the 3-hourly scale compared to the daily scale in most cities in humid regions. However, we found no significant impact of urbanization on extreme rainfall across continental climate regions like the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei. Furthermore, we also found that urbanization alters the trends of heavy rainfall during daytime and nighttime, with significant regional variations linked to impervious surface coverage. Our findings provide essential scientific evidence to assist cities in designing targeted disaster mitigation policies, especially for those with diverse contexts and development patterns.,Communications Earth & Environment
ROBIN: Reference observatory of basins for international hydrological climate change detection,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04907-y,2025-04-18,Human-induced warming is modifying the water cycle. Adaptation to posed threats requires an understanding of hydrological responses to climate variability. Whilst these can be computationally modelled, observed streamflow data is essential for constraining models, and understanding and quantifying emerging trends in the water cycle. To date, the identification of such trends at the global scale has been hindered by data limitations – in particular, the prevalence of direct human influences on streamflow which can obscure climate-driven variability. By removing these influences, trends in streamflow data can be more confidently attributed to climate variability. Here we describe the Reference Observatory of Basins for INternational hydrological climate change detection (ROBIN) – the first iteration of a global network of streamflow data from national reference hydrological networks (RHNs) – comprised of catchments which are near-natural or have limited human influences. This collaboration has established a freely available global RHN dataset of over 3,000 catchments and code libraries, which can be used to underpin new science endeavours and advance change detection studies to support international climate policy and adaptation.,Scientific Data
Global assessment and hotspots of lake drought,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02285-2,2025-04-21,Many lakes have exhibited substantial variability in recent years, making “lake drought” a growing concern. However, there is no established framework for identifying and studying lake droughts. Here, we propose a reliable definition for it and provide a global assessment of over 160,000 lakes (≥1 km<sup>2</sup>) using monthly area data from 1985 to 2018. Our findings show that 15.7% of lakes have experienced statistically significant increasing trends in drought frequency (p &lt; 0.05), with hotspots in the Southern United States at 52.7% and Southeast Australia at 70.4%. Furthermore, we identify two severe lake drought events in the Southern United States (2012–2014) and Southeast Australia (2007–2010), posing dramatic threats to water supplies, biodiversity, and ecological health. Rising trends in lake drought are driven by increasing temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and factors associated with the lake water cycle, such as precipitation deficit, increased evaporation, and excessive water withdrawal.,Communications Earth & Environment
