Overlooked discrepancies in protocols undermine coastal restoration practices in China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-01995-x,2025-01-09,To improve the success of expanding ecosystem restoration efforts, technical guiding-standards are being developed in many nations. Whether these protocols have been well adopted to guide restoration practices remains unknown, especially in developing countries where policies evolve rapidly to balance socioeconomic development with ecosystem restoration. By conducting text semantic mining analyses, we reveal widespread discrepancies between China’s coastal restoration practices and protocols over the past four decades. Over 60% of executed restoration projects had no detailed technical standards to guide implementation, especially for severely degraded ecosystems. Development of these standards lagged significantly behind project implementation, was poorly enforced, and focused more on monitoring than guiding good restoration designs and adaptive management, likely undermining restoration performance. Nevertheless, current policies toward prioritizing ecosystem restoration offer opportunities to remedy this issue. Enforcing policies to ensure that practices are guided by protocols is necessary to promote coastal restoration success in China and globally as nations strive to achieve ambitious restoration targets.

Hydroclimate volatility on a warming Earth,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-024-00624-z,2025-01-09,Hydroclimate volatility refers to sudden, large and/or frequent transitions between very dry and very wet conditions. In this Review, we examine how hydroclimate volatility is anticipated to evolve with anthropogenic warming. Using a metric of ‘hydroclimate whiplash’ based on the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, global-averaged subseasonal (3-month) and interannual (12-month) whiplash have increased by 31–66% and 8–31%, respectively, since the mid-twentieth century. Further increases are anticipated with ongoing warming, including subseasonal increases of 113% and interannual increases of 52% over land areas with 3 °C of warming; these changes are largest at high latitudes and from northern Africa eastward into South Asia. Extensive evidence links these increases primarily to thermodynamics, namely the rising water-vapour-holding capacity and potential evaporative demand of the atmosphere. Increases in hydroclimate volatility will amplify hazards associated with rapid swings between wet and dry states (including flash floods, wildfires, landslides and disease outbreaks), and could accelerate a water management shift towards co-management of drought and flood risks. A clearer understanding of plausible future trajectories of hydroclimate volatility requires expanded focus on the response of atmospheric circulation to regional and global forcings, as well as land–ocean–atmosphere feedbacks, using large ensemble climate model simulations, storm-resolving high-resolution models and emerging machine learning methods.

Decoupling of surface water storage from precipitation in global drylands due to anthropogenic activity,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00367-7,2025-01-10,The availability of surface water in global drylands is essential for both human society and ecosystems. However, the long-term drivers of change in surface water storage, particularly those related to anthropogenic activities, remain unclear. Here we use multi-mission remote sensing data to construct monthly time series of water storage changes from 1985 to 2020 for 105,400 lakes and reservoirs in global drylands. An increase of 2.20 km<sup>3</sup> per year in surface water storage is found primarily due to the construction of new reservoirs. For lakes and old reservoirs (constructed before 1983), conversely, the trend in storage is minor when aggregated globally, but they dominate surface water storage trends in 91% of individual global dryland basins. Further analysis reveals that long-term storage changes in these water bodies are primarily linked to anthropogenic factors—including human-induced warming and water-management practices—rather than to precipitation changes, as previously thought. These findings reveal a decoupling of surface water storage from precipitation in global drylands, raising concerns about societal and ecosystem sustainability.

A new look at Earth’s water and energy with SWOT,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00372-w,2025-01-13,As the planet transitions to a new climate, adapting to the Earth’s changing water cycle remains among the top challenges faced by humanity. The relative stability of climate and water resources over the past millennia allowed humans to build complex societies with established agriculture, infrastructure and economies that today sustain the livelihood of eight billion people. As the planet warms, this steady state of water movement is being altered, and both oceanic and terrestrial components of the global water cycle are undergoing measurable changes that will probably continue. Predicting the new trajectory of Earth’s water in a warming climate begins with observing the entire water supply–demand chain across the planet, from Earth’s largest water reservoir, the ocean, to water storage, use and recycling on land. A recently launched space observatory, called the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT), is making a timely entrance and addition to the water-observing networks, by providing direct, high-resolution measurements of the water height and volume of nearly all water on the Earth’s surface. Here we link technological advances in wide-swath satellite altimetry and SWOT’s novel measurements of water volume across the planet to scientific innovations for Earth’s water cycle, including studies of changes in the water storage and dynamics in global lakes and rivers, rising seas, ocean energetics and land–ocean exchange, with implications for practical information for water resource managers and climate resilience efforts. We also discuss how SWOT innovations set the stage for future missions and integrated Earth-system approaches within the water science community.

Episodic warm climates on early Mars primed by crustal hydration,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01626-8,2025-01-15,Geological records indicate that the surface of ancient Mars harboured substantial volumes of liquid water, a resource gradually diminished by processes such as the chemical alteration of crustal materials by hydration and atmospheric escape. However, how a relatively warm climate existed on early Mars to support liquid water under a fainter young Sun is debated. Greenhouse gases such as H<sub>2</sub> in a CO<sub>2</sub>-rich atmosphere could have contributed to warming through collision-induced absorption, but whether sufficient H<sub>2</sub> was available to sustain warming remains unclear. Here we use a combined climate and photochemical model to simulate how atmospheric chemistry on early Mars responded to water–rock reactions and climate variations, as constrained by existing observations. We find that H<sub>2</sub> outgassing from crustal hydration and oxidation, supplemented by transient volcanic activity, could have generated sufficient H<sub>2</sub> fluxes to transiently foster warm, humid climates. We estimate that Mars experienced episodic warm periods of an integrated duration of ~40 million years, with each event lasting ≥10<sup>5</sup> years, consistent with the formation timescale of valley networks. Declining atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> via surface oxidant sinks or variations in the planet’s axial tilt could have led to abrupt shifts in the planet’s redox state and transition to a CO-dominated atmosphere and cold climate.

Hydroclimatic extremes threaten groundwater quality and stability,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-55890-2,2025-01-16,Heavy precipitation, drought, and other hydroclimatic extremes occur more frequently than in the past climate reference period (1961–1990). Given their strong effect on groundwater recharge dynamics, these phenomena increase the vulnerability of groundwater quantity and quality. Over the course of the past decade, we have documented changes in the composition of dissolved organic matter in groundwater. We show that fractions of ingressing surface-derived organic molecules increased significantly as groundwater levels declined, whereas concentrations of dissolved organic carbon remained constant. Molecular composition changeover was accelerated following 2018’s extreme summer drought. These findings demonstrate that hydroclimatic extremes promote rapid transport between surface ecosystems and groundwaters, thereby enabling xenobiotic substances to evade microbial processing, accrue in greater abundance in groundwater, and potentially compromise the safe nature of these potable water sources. Groundwater quality is far more vulnerable to the impact of recent climate anomalies than is currently recognized, and the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter can be used as a comprehensive indicator for groundwater quality deterioration.

Accounting for differences between crops and regions reduces estimates of nitrate leaching from nitrogen-fertilized soils,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02001-0,2025-01-16,Nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>) leaching from nitrogen (N) fertilized soils is a significant global concern, affecting both the environment and public health. However, substantial uncertainties and variabilities in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leaching factors (LFs) among regions or crops impede accurate assessments of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leaching. Here we synthesize 2500 field observations worldwide and show that LFs vary by an order of magnitude across regions and crops, primarily driven by hydroclimatic and edaphic conditions rather than N fertilizer management. Global cropland NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leaching from synthetic N fertilization, calculated through spatially explicit (15.4, 14.8–16.1 Tg N yr<sup>–1</sup>) and crop-specific (12.9, 11.0–14.8 Tg N yr<sup>–1</sup>) LFs, is 41% lower than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Tier 1 global inventory. Over 47% of this leaching is concentrated in China, India, and the United States, with maize, wheat, rice and vegetables accounting for nearly half of it. Improved regional and crop-specific LFs will provide a benchmark for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leaching abatement by pinpointing potential global hotspots.

Gross primary productivity is more sensitive to accelerated flash droughts,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02013-w,2025-01-17,Flash droughts, characterized by their rapid onset, substantially affect terrestrial ecosystems. However, the sensitivity of ecosystem productivity to the rapid development of flash droughts under varying vegetation conditions remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the ecosystem response to the speed of flash drought onset for different plant functional types, considering the decline rate of root-zone soil moisture and standardized gross primary productivity anomaly. Our findings reveal a significant increase of approximately 10% in the proportion of 1- and 2-pentad (5 and 10 days) onset flash droughts leading to negative standardized gross primary productivity anomalies during 2001–2018. Furthermore, while standardized gross primary productivity anomalies decline at higher rates, they do not promptly respond on a shorter timescale to faster-onset flash droughts compared to slower-onset flash droughts. Vegetation types with shallower root systems exhibit higher sensitivities to faster-onset flash droughts, suggesting an escalating threat to terrestrial ecosystems in a changing climate.

Counteracting greenhouse gas and aerosol influences intensify global water seasonality over the past century,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02025-6,2025-01-18,Variations in water availability seasonality significantly impact society and ecosystems. While many studies have focused on mean or extreme precipitation, the response of water availability seasonality, influencing yearly water distribution beyond individual extremes, to human-induced climate change remains underexplored. Here we examine global and regional water availability seasonality changes from 1915 to 2014, quantifying how anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols have influenced these variations using reanalysis and simulations from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. Despite large spatiotemporal uncertainties due to regional variability and model assumptions, we find that greenhouse gases significantly amplify the seasonality, while aerosols reduce it. Given that the positive effects of greenhouse gases surpass the aerosols’ negative effects, the counterbalancing influences have led to an overall enhancement in seasonality of water availability over the past century. This trend is expected to continue in the future as greenhouse gases-induced warming continues to rise and aerosol levels decline.

The first geospatial dataset of irrigated fields (2020–2024) in Vojvodina (Serbia),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04443-9,2025-01-18,Irrigation is a cornerstone of global food security, enabling sustainable agricultural production and helping to ensure that food is available for people around the world, now and in the future. Mapping irrigated fields provides valuable information for sustainable water management, agricultural development, and environmental conservation efforts. However, the collection of high-quality training data, which is necessary for accurate irrigation mapping remains costly and labour-intensive. To address this, we created a georeferenced regional dataset consisting of location, crop type, and occurrence of the irrigation equipment which are essential information for mapping irrigated fields. Four main irrigated crops were considered: maize, soybean, sugar beet, and wheat. The dataset, consisting of a total of 1256 parcels, is created for Vojvodina, the main agricultural area in Serbia, spanning the period of five years (2020–2024). This study’s goal is to give accessibility to our dataset which further can be explored and used for building or fine-tuning machine learning and deep learning models for the automatic detection of irrigated fields using satellite imagery.

Gross primary productivity is more sensitive to accelerated flash droughts,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02013-w,2025-01-17,Flash droughts, characterized by their rapid onset, substantially affect terrestrial ecosystems. However, the sensitivity of ecosystem productivity to the rapid development of flash droughts under varying vegetation conditions remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the ecosystem response to the speed of flash drought onset for different plant functional types, considering the decline rate of root-zone soil moisture and standardized gross primary productivity anomaly. Our findings reveal a significant increase of approximately 10% in the proportion of 1- and 2-pentad (5 and 10 days) onset flash droughts leading to negative standardized gross primary productivity anomalies during 2001–2018. Furthermore, while standardized gross primary productivity anomalies decline at higher rates, they do not promptly respond on a shorter timescale to faster-onset flash droughts compared to slower-onset flash droughts. Vegetation types with shallower root systems exhibit higher sensitivities to faster-onset flash droughts, suggesting an escalating threat to terrestrial ecosystems in a changing climate.

Counteracting greenhouse gas and aerosol influences intensify global water seasonality over the past century,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02025-6,2025-01-18,Variations in water availability seasonality significantly impact society and ecosystems. While many studies have focused on mean or extreme precipitation, the response of water availability seasonality, influencing yearly water distribution beyond individual extremes, to human-induced climate change remains underexplored. Here we examine global and regional water availability seasonality changes from 1915 to 2014, quantifying how anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols have influenced these variations using reanalysis and simulations from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. Despite large spatiotemporal uncertainties due to regional variability and model assumptions, we find that greenhouse gases significantly amplify the seasonality, while aerosols reduce it. Given that the positive effects of greenhouse gases surpass the aerosols’ negative effects, the counterbalancing influences have led to an overall enhancement in seasonality of water availability over the past century. This trend is expected to continue in the future as greenhouse gases-induced warming continues to rise and aerosol levels decline.

The first geospatial dataset of irrigated fields (2020–2024) in Vojvodina (Serbia),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04443-9,2025-01-18,Irrigation is a cornerstone of global food security, enabling sustainable agricultural production and helping to ensure that food is available for people around the world, now and in the future. Mapping irrigated fields provides valuable information for sustainable water management, agricultural development, and environmental conservation efforts. However, the collection of high-quality training data, which is necessary for accurate irrigation mapping remains costly and labour-intensive. To address this, we created a georeferenced regional dataset consisting of location, crop type, and occurrence of the irrigation equipment which are essential information for mapping irrigated fields. Four main irrigated crops were considered: maize, soybean, sugar beet, and wheat. The dataset, consisting of a total of 1256 parcels, is created for Vojvodina, the main agricultural area in Serbia, spanning the period of five years (2020–2024). This study’s goal is to give accessibility to our dataset which further can be explored and used for building or fine-tuning machine learning and deep learning models for the automatic detection of irrigated fields using satellite imagery.

Flood modeling prior to the instrumental era reveals limited magnitude of 1931 Yangtze flood,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00908-1,2025-01-19,The global flood risk urges an improved understanding of flood magnitude and its mechanism, which needs insights from pre-instrumental flood investigations. Due to data scarcity, reconstructing pre-instrumental flood magnitudes relies on statistical downscaling, failing to capture nonlinear and dynamic characteristics. We developed a dynamical approach, NorESM-WRF-SWAT, integrating a global climate, a regional, and a hydrologic model to investigate the 1931 Yangtze River flood (the deadliest in the world) and compared it with the 1998’s. Through validation, our method outperforms the statistical method in simulating precipitations and river discharges. For the first time, we presented detailed insights into the intensity and duration of the 1931 flood, revealing a smaller magnitude but associated with an amplified loss, likely due to social vulnerability and reduced societal resilience compared to the 1998’s. While successful simulation can be interfered with by model variability, our dynamical method shows promise for simulating pre-instrumental flood and building a long-term pre-instrumental-hydrology database.

Hydroclimate volatility on a warming Earth,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-024-00624-z,2025-01-09,Hydroclimate volatility refers to sudden, large and/or frequent transitions between very dry and very wet conditions. In this Review, we examine how hydroclimate volatility is anticipated to evolve with anthropogenic warming. Using a metric of ‘hydroclimate whiplash’ based on the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, global-averaged subseasonal (3-month) and interannual (12-month) whiplash have increased by 31–66% and 8–31%, respectively, since the mid-twentieth century. Further increases are anticipated with ongoing warming, including subseasonal increases of 113% and interannual increases of 52% over land areas with 3 °C of warming; these changes are largest at high latitudes and from northern Africa eastward into South Asia. Extensive evidence links these increases primarily to thermodynamics, namely the rising water-vapour-holding capacity and potential evaporative demand of the atmosphere. Increases in hydroclimate volatility will amplify hazards associated with rapid swings between wet and dry states (including flash floods, wildfires, landslides and disease outbreaks), and could accelerate a water management shift towards co-management of drought and flood risks. A clearer understanding of plausible future trajectories of hydroclimate volatility requires expanded focus on the response of atmospheric circulation to regional and global forcings, as well as land–ocean–atmosphere feedbacks, using large ensemble climate model simulations, storm-resolving high-resolution models and emerging machine learning methods.

Decoupling of surface water storage from precipitation in global drylands due to anthropogenic activity,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00367-7,2025-01-10,The availability of surface water in global drylands is essential for both human society and ecosystems. However, the long-term drivers of change in surface water storage, particularly those related to anthropogenic activities, remain unclear. Here we use multi-mission remote sensing data to construct monthly time series of water storage changes from 1985 to 2020 for 105,400 lakes and reservoirs in global drylands. An increase of 2.20 km<sup>3</sup> per year in surface water storage is found primarily due to the construction of new reservoirs. For lakes and old reservoirs (constructed before 1983), conversely, the trend in storage is minor when aggregated globally, but they dominate surface water storage trends in 91% of individual global dryland basins. Further analysis reveals that long-term storage changes in these water bodies are primarily linked to anthropogenic factors—including human-induced warming and water-management practices—rather than to precipitation changes, as previously thought. These findings reveal a decoupling of surface water storage from precipitation in global drylands, raising concerns about societal and ecosystem sustainability.

A new look at Earth’s water and energy with SWOT,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00372-w,2025-01-13,As the planet transitions to a new climate, adapting to the Earth’s changing water cycle remains among the top challenges faced by humanity. The relative stability of climate and water resources over the past millennia allowed humans to build complex societies with established agriculture, infrastructure and economies that today sustain the livelihood of eight billion people. As the planet warms, this steady state of water movement is being altered, and both oceanic and terrestrial components of the global water cycle are undergoing measurable changes that will probably continue. Predicting the new trajectory of Earth’s water in a warming climate begins with observing the entire water supply–demand chain across the planet, from Earth’s largest water reservoir, the ocean, to water storage, use and recycling on land. A recently launched space observatory, called the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT), is making a timely entrance and addition to the water-observing networks, by providing direct, high-resolution measurements of the water height and volume of nearly all water on the Earth’s surface. Here we link technological advances in wide-swath satellite altimetry and SWOT’s novel measurements of water volume across the planet to scientific innovations for Earth’s water cycle, including studies of changes in the water storage and dynamics in global lakes and rivers, rising seas, ocean energetics and land–ocean exchange, with implications for practical information for water resource managers and climate resilience efforts. We also discuss how SWOT innovations set the stage for future missions and integrated Earth-system approaches within the water science community.

Episodic warm climates on early Mars primed by crustal hydration,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01626-8,2025-01-15,Geological records indicate that the surface of ancient Mars harboured substantial volumes of liquid water, a resource gradually diminished by processes such as the chemical alteration of crustal materials by hydration and atmospheric escape. However, how a relatively warm climate existed on early Mars to support liquid water under a fainter young Sun is debated. Greenhouse gases such as H<sub>2</sub> in a CO<sub>2</sub>-rich atmosphere could have contributed to warming through collision-induced absorption, but whether sufficient H<sub>2</sub> was available to sustain warming remains unclear. Here we use a combined climate and photochemical model to simulate how atmospheric chemistry on early Mars responded to water–rock reactions and climate variations, as constrained by existing observations. We find that H<sub>2</sub> outgassing from crustal hydration and oxidation, supplemented by transient volcanic activity, could have generated sufficient H<sub>2</sub> fluxes to transiently foster warm, humid climates. We estimate that Mars experienced episodic warm periods of an integrated duration of ~40 million years, with each event lasting ≥10<sup>5</sup> years, consistent with the formation timescale of valley networks. Declining atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> via surface oxidant sinks or variations in the planet’s axial tilt could have led to abrupt shifts in the planet’s redox state and transition to a CO-dominated atmosphere and cold climate.

Hydroclimatic extremes threaten groundwater quality and stability,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-55890-2,2025-01-16,Heavy precipitation, drought, and other hydroclimatic extremes occur more frequently than in the past climate reference period (1961–1990). Given their strong effect on groundwater recharge dynamics, these phenomena increase the vulnerability of groundwater quantity and quality. Over the course of the past decade, we have documented changes in the composition of dissolved organic matter in groundwater. We show that fractions of ingressing surface-derived organic molecules increased significantly as groundwater levels declined, whereas concentrations of dissolved organic carbon remained constant. Molecular composition changeover was accelerated following 2018’s extreme summer drought. These findings demonstrate that hydroclimatic extremes promote rapid transport between surface ecosystems and groundwaters, thereby enabling xenobiotic substances to evade microbial processing, accrue in greater abundance in groundwater, and potentially compromise the safe nature of these potable water sources. Groundwater quality is far more vulnerable to the impact of recent climate anomalies than is currently recognized, and the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter can be used as a comprehensive indicator for groundwater quality deterioration.

Accounting for differences between crops and regions reduces estimates of nitrate leaching from nitrogen-fertilized soils,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02001-0,2025-01-16,Nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>) leaching from nitrogen (N) fertilized soils is a significant global concern, affecting both the environment and public health. However, substantial uncertainties and variabilities in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leaching factors (LFs) among regions or crops impede accurate assessments of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leaching. Here we synthesize 2500 field observations worldwide and show that LFs vary by an order of magnitude across regions and crops, primarily driven by hydroclimatic and edaphic conditions rather than N fertilizer management. Global cropland NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leaching from synthetic N fertilization, calculated through spatially explicit (15.4, 14.8–16.1 Tg N yr<sup>–1</sup>) and crop-specific (12.9, 11.0–14.8 Tg N yr<sup>–1</sup>) LFs, is 41% lower than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Tier 1 global inventory.

Improved regional and crop-specific LFs will provide a benchmark for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leaching abatement by pinpointing potential global hotspots.

Emergent constraints on global soil moisture projections under climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02024-7,2025-01-20,Surface soil moisture is projected to decrease under global warming. Such projections are mostly based on climate models, which show large uncertainty (i.e., inter-model spread) partly due to inadequate observational constraint. Here we identify strong physically-based emergent relationships between soil moisture change (2070–2099 minus 1980–2014) and recent air temperature and precipitation trends across an ensemble of climate models. We extend the commonly used univariate Emergent Constraints to a bivariate method and use observed temperature and precipitation trends to constrain global soil moisture changes. Our results show that the bivariate emergent constraints can reduce soil moisture change uncertainty by 7.87%, which is four times more effective than traditional temperature-based univariate constraints. The bivariate emergent constraints change the sign of soil moisture change from negative to positive for semi-arid, dry sub-humid and humid regions and global land as a whole, but exacerbates the drying trend in arid and hyper-arid regions.

Increasing certainty in projected local extreme precipitation change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56235-9,2025-01-20,The latest climate models project widely varying magnitudes of future extreme precipitation changes, thus impeding effective adaptation planning. Many observational constraints have been proposed to reduce the uncertainty of these projections at global to sub-continental scales, but adaptation generally requires detailed, local scale information. Here, we present a temperature-based adaptative emergent constraint strategy combined with data aggregation that reduces the error variance of projected end-of-century changes in annual extremes of daily precipitation under a high emissions scenario by &gt;20% across most areas of the world. These improved projections could benefit nearly 90% of the world’s population by permitting better impact assessment and adaptation planning at local levels. Our physically motivated strategy, which considers the thermodynamic and dynamic components of projected extreme precipitation change, exploits the link between global warming and the thermodynamic component of extreme precipitation. Rigorous cross-validation provides strong evidence of its reliability in constraining local extreme precipitation projections.

Dichotomy retreat and aqueous alteration on Noachian Mars recorded in highland remnants,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01634-8,2025-01-20,The Mawrth Vallis region is a plateau situated on the highland side of Mars’ hemispheric dichotomy boundary. It has a &gt;200-m-thick phyllosilicate-bearing stratigraphic succession that indicates extensive aqueous alteration between 4.1 Ga and 3.7 Ga, during the Noachian Period. In addition, thousands of kilometre-scale isolated mounds in the lowlands north and west of Mawrth Vallis have been identified. Here we use geomorphological and spectroscopic analyses to show that the mounds are erosional remnants that formed through retreat of the highland plateau in the Noachian. Consequently, the escarpment that marks the surface expression of the dichotomy must have receded south-southeast by hundreds of kilometres in this area. Lateral and stratigraphic geochemical variation in the mounds show that widespread, multiphase aqueous alteration occurred in situ across this region in surface and subsurface environments. The mound succession is underlain by a pyroxene-rich unit that represents unaltered material below the regional phyllosilicate-bearing sequence and is unconformably overlain by a thin capping unit that marks the end of large-scale regional aqueous activity. Thus, the mounds contain a stratigraphic record of the onset, evolution and cessation of Noachian aqueous conditions in this region, detailing the environment and climate of Mars at its most habitable.

Projected runoff declines from plant physiological effects on precipitation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00361-z,2025-01-20,The impact of plants on runoff under high atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is a major uncertainty for future water resources. Theory and Earth system models (ESMs) suggest that stricter plant stomatal regulation under high CO<sub>2</sub> will reduce transpiration, potentially boosting runoff. Yet, across a 12-member ensemble of idealized ESM simulations that isolate plant responses to CO<sub>2</sub>, we show that lower transpiration robustly enhances runoff over only 5% of modelled global land area. Precipitation changes are five times more important than transpiration changes in driving runoff responses and are a significant signal of CO<sub>2</sub> physiological forcing over 31–57% of land areas across models. Crucially, ESMs largely disagree on where physiologically forced precipitation changes occur but agree that plant responses in most locations are as likely to reduce runoff as increase it. These results imply that large model uncertainties in precipitation responses, rather than transpiration responses, explain why ESMs disagree on plant physiologically driven runoff changes.

Measurements of groundwater, hydrodynamics, and sand characteristics at a dissipative sea turtle nesting beach,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04455-5,2025-01-21,Beach groundwater and nearshore hydrodynamic data were collected during a field experiment along two dissipative beach transects on Galveston Island, Texas, in the fall of 2023. The monitored beaches serve as nesting habitat for the critically endangered Kemp’s ridley sea turtle. Conditions ranged from calm to stormy, with two storms occurring during the experiment, inundating the entire beach up to the dune toe. Collected hydrodynamic data include readings from pressure loggers submerged in the foreshore and mounted in groundwater wells in the backshore, data from two wave buoys about 1.5 km offshore, and GoPro timestacks of the instantaneous waterline (wave runup). Other collected data include bathymetry and topography surveys, subsurface temperature and moisture content readings, and sediment characteristics. This comprehensive dataset can be used to (1) study relevant beach inundation and groundwater processes, including their effect on the local ecosystem (e.g., repeated flooding of sea turtle nests), (2) study the propagation of nearshore hydrodynamic processes into the beach matrix and groundwater table, and (3) validate existing beach groundwater models.

GEM-Hydro achieves satisfactory simulations of various hydrologic variables when compared to reference datasets. This dataset can be used for example to drive any routing model, compute climatologies or statistics for different hydrologic variables and study their variability as a function of the local geo-morphology, etc.

Flood modeling prior to the instrumental era reveals limited magnitude of 1931 Yangtze flood,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00908-1,2025-01-19,The global flood risk urges an improved understanding of flood magnitude and its mechanism, which needs insights from pre-instrumental flood investigations. Due to data scarcity, reconstructing pre-instrumental flood magnitudes relies on statistical downscaling, failing to capture nonlinear and dynamic characteristics. We developed a dynamical approach, NorESM-WRF-SWAT, integrating a global climate, a regional, and a hydrologic model to investigate the 1931 Yangtze River flood (the deadliest in the world) and compared it with the 1998’s. Through validation, our method outperforms the statistical method in simulating precipitations and river discharges. For the first time, we presented detailed insights into the intensity and duration of the 1931 flood, revealing a smaller magnitude but associated with an amplified loss, likely due to social vulnerability and reduced societal resilience compared to the 1998’s. While successful simulation can be interfered with by model variability, our dynamical method shows promise for simulating pre-instrumental flood and building a long-term pre-instrumental-hydrology database.

Emergent constraints on global soil moisture projections under climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02024-7,2025-01-20,Surface soil moisture is projected to decrease under global warming. Such projections are mostly based on climate models, which show large uncertainty (i.e., inter-model spread) partly due to inadequate observational constraint. Here we identify strong physically-based emergent relationships between soil moisture change (2070–2099 minus 1980–2014) and recent air temperature and precipitation trends across an ensemble of climate models. We extend the commonly used univariate Emergent Constraints to a bivariate method and use observed temperature and precipitation trends to constrain global soil moisture changes. Our results show that the bivariate emergent constraints can reduce soil moisture change uncertainty by 7.87%, which is four times more effective than traditional temperature-based univariate constraints. The bivariate emergent constraints change the sign of soil moisture change from negative to positive for semi-arid, dry sub-humid and humid regions and global land as a whole, but exacerbates the drying trend in arid and hyper-arid regions.

Increasing certainty in projected local extreme precipitation change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56235-9,2025-01-20,The latest climate models project widely varying magnitudes of future extreme precipitation changes, thus impeding effective adaptation planning. Many observational constraints have been proposed to reduce the uncertainty of these projections at global to sub-continental scales, but adaptation generally requires detailed, local scale information. Here, we present a temperature-based adaptative emergent constraint strategy combined with data aggregation that reduces the error variance of projected end-of-century changes in annual extremes of daily precipitation under a high emissions scenario by &gt;20% across most areas of the world. These improved projections could benefit nearly 90% of the world’s population by permitting better impact assessment and adaptation planning at local levels. Our physically motivated strategy, which considers the thermodynamic and dynamic components of projected extreme precipitation change, exploits the link between global warming and the thermodynamic component of extreme precipitation. Rigorous cross-validation provides strong evidence of its reliability in constraining local extreme precipitation projections.

Dichotomy retreat and aqueous alteration on Noachian Mars recorded in highland remnants,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01634-8,2025-01-20,The Mawrth Vallis region is a plateau situated on the highland side of Mars’ hemispheric dichotomy boundary. It has a &gt;200-m-thick phyllosilicate-bearing stratigraphic succession that indicates extensive aqueous alteration between 4.1 Ga and 3.7 Ga, during the Noachian Period. In addition, thousands of kilometre-scale isolated mounds in the lowlands north and west of Mawrth Vallis have been identified. Here we use geomorphological and spectroscopic analyses to show that the mounds are erosional remnants that formed through retreat of the highland plateau in the Noachian. Consequently, the escarpment that marks the surface expression of the dichotomy must have receded south-southeast by hundreds of kilometres in this area. Lateral and stratigraphic geochemical variation in the mounds show that widespread, multiphase aqueous alteration occurred in situ across this region in surface and subsurface environments. The mound succession is underlain by a pyroxene-rich unit that represents unaltered material below the regional phyllosilicate-bearing sequence and is unconformably overlain by a thin capping unit that marks the end of large-scale regional aqueous activity. Thus, the mounds contain a stratigraphic record of the onset, evolution and cessation of Noachian aqueous conditions in this region, detailing the environment and climate of Mars at its most habitable.

Projected runoff declines from plant physiological effects on precipitation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00361-z,2025-01-20,The impact of plants on runoff under high atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is a major uncertainty for future water resources. Theory and Earth system models (ESMs) suggest that stricter plant stomatal regulation under high CO<sub>2</sub> will reduce transpiration, potentially boosting runoff. Yet, across a 12-member ensemble of idealized ESM simulations that isolate plant responses to CO<sub>2</sub>, we show that lower transpiration robustly enhances runoff over only 5% of modelled global land area. Precipitation changes are five times more important than transpiration changes in driving runoff responses and are a significant signal of CO<sub>2</sub> physiological forcing over 31–57% of land areas across models. Crucially, ESMs largely disagree on where physiologically forced precipitation changes occur but agree that plant responses in most locations are as likely to reduce runoff as increase it. These results imply that large model uncertainties in precipitation responses, rather than transpiration responses, explain why ESMs disagree on plant physiologically driven runoff changes.

Measurements of groundwater, hydrodynamics, and sand characteristics at a dissipative sea turtle nesting beach,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04455-5,2025-01-21,Beach groundwater and nearshore hydrodynamic data were collected during a field experiment along two dissipative beach transects on Galveston Island, Texas, in the fall of 2023. The monitored beaches serve as nesting habitat for the critically endangered Kemp’s ridley sea turtle. Conditions ranged from calm to stormy, with two storms occurring during the experiment, inundating the entire beach up to the dune toe. Collected hydrodynamic data include readings from pressure loggers submerged in the foreshore and mounted in groundwater wells in the backshore, data from two wave buoys about 1.5 km offshore, and GoPro timestacks of the instantaneous waterline (wave runup). Other collected data include bathymetry and topography surveys, subsurface temperature and moisture content readings, and sediment characteristics. This comprehensive dataset can be used to (1) study relevant beach inundation and groundwater processes, including their effect on the local ecosystem (e.g., repeated flooding of sea turtle nests), (2) study the propagation of nearshore hydrodynamic processes into the beach matrix and groundwater table, and (3) validate existing beach groundwater models.

The dataset covers the basins of the Laurentian Great Lakes and the Ottawa River and extends over the period 2001–2018. The data consist of all variables (hourly fluxes and state variables) related to the water balance of GEM-Hydro’s land-surface scheme (including precipitation, surface and sub-surface runoff, drainage, evaporation, snow water equivalent, soil moisture…) and mean daily streamflow at 212 gauge locations. These outputs were simulated with a calibrated version of the GEM-Hydro model that was run in open-loop mode (no assimilation) and driven with atmospheric forcings coming from ECCC’s Canadian Surface Reanalysis version 2.1. GEM-Hydro achieves satisfactory simulations of various hydrologic variables when compared to reference datasets. This dataset can be used for example to drive any routing model, compute climatologies or statistics for different hydrologic variables and study their variability as a function of the local geo-morphology, etc.

Gross primary productivity is more sensitive to accelerated flash droughts,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02013-w,2025-01-17,Flash droughts, characterized by their rapid onset, substantially affect terrestrial ecosystems. However, the sensitivity of ecosystem productivity to the rapid development of flash droughts under varying vegetation conditions remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the ecosystem response to the speed of flash drought onset for different plant functional types, considering the decline rate of root-zone soil moisture and standardized gross primary productivity anomaly. Our findings reveal a significant increase of approximately 10% in the proportion of 1- and 2-pentad (5 and 10 days) onset flash droughts leading to negative standardized gross primary productivity anomalies during 2001–2018. Furthermore, while standardized gross primary productivity anomalies decline at higher rates, they do not promptly respond on a shorter timescale to faster-onset flash droughts compared to slower-onset flash droughts. Vegetation types with shallower root systems exhibit higher sensitivities to faster-onset flash droughts, suggesting an escalating threat to terrestrial ecosystems in a changing climate.

Counteracting greenhouse gas and aerosol influences intensify global water seasonality over the past century,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02025-6,2025-01-18,Variations in water availability seasonality significantly impact society and ecosystems. While many studies have focused on mean or extreme precipitation, the response of water availability seasonality, influencing yearly water distribution beyond individual extremes, to human-induced climate change remains underexplored. Here we examine global and regional water availability seasonality changes from 1915 to 2014, quantifying how anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols have influenced these variations using reanalysis and simulations from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. Despite large spatiotemporal uncertainties due to regional variability and model assumptions, we find that greenhouse gases significantly amplify the seasonality, while aerosols reduce it. Given that the positive effects of greenhouse gases surpass the aerosols’ negative effects, the counterbalancing influences have led to an overall enhancement in seasonality of water availability over the past century. This trend is expected to continue in the future as greenhouse gases-induced warming continues to rise and aerosol levels decline.

The first geospatial dataset of irrigated fields (2020–2024) in Vojvodina (Serbia),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04443-9,2025-01-18,Irrigation is a cornerstone of global food security, enabling sustainable agricultural production and helping to ensure that food is available for people around the world, now and in the future. Mapping irrigated fields provides valuable information for sustainable water management, agricultural development, and environmental conservation efforts. However, the collection of high-quality training data, which is necessary for accurate irrigation mapping remains costly and labour-intensive. To address this, we created a georeferenced regional dataset consisting of location, crop type, and occurrence of the irrigation equipment which are essential information for mapping irrigated fields. Four main irrigated crops were considered: maize, soybean, sugar beet, and wheat. The dataset, consisting of a total of 1256 parcels, is created for Vojvodina, the main agricultural area in Serbia, spanning the period of five years (2020–2024). This study’s goal is to give accessibility to our dataset which further can be explored and used for building or fine-tuning machine learning and deep learning models for the automatic detection of irrigated fields using satellite imagery.

Multifaceted changes in water availability with a warmer climate,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00913-4,2025-01-24,Climate warming alters spatial and seasonal patterns of surface water availability (P-E), affecting runoff and terrestrial water storage. However, a comprehensive assessment of these changes across various hydroclimates remains lacking. We develop a multi-model ensemble approach to classify global terrestrial hydroclimate into four distinct regimes based on the mean and seasonality of P-E. P-E is projected to become increasingly variable across space and time. Wet regions with low and high seasonality are likely to experience more concentrated increases in wet-season runoff by up to 20%, highlighting potential increases in flood-related vulnerability. Low-seasonality regions exhibit faster wet-season increases and more rapid dry-season decreases in soil moisture, heightening the likelihood of water scarcity and drought. Conversely, dry regions with high seasonality are less sensitive to climate change. These findings underscore the multifaceted impacts of climate change on global water resources, necessitating the need for tailored adaptation strategies for different hydroclimate regimes.

The first geospatial dataset of irrigated fields (2020–2024) in Vojvodina (Serbia),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04443-9,2025-01-18,Irrigation is a cornerstone of global food security, enabling sustainable agricultural production and helping to ensure that food is available for people around the world, now and in the future. Mapping irrigated fields provides valuable information for sustainable water management, agricultural development, and environmental conservation efforts. However, the collection of high-quality training data, which is necessary for accurate irrigation mapping remains costly and labour-intensive. To address this, we created a georeferenced regional dataset consisting of location, crop type, and occurrence of the irrigation equipment which are essential information for mapping irrigated fields. Four main irrigated crops were considered: maize, soybean, sugar beet, and wheat. The dataset, consisting of a total of 1256 parcels, is created for Vojvodina, the main agricultural area in Serbia, spanning the period of five years (2020–2024). This study’s goal is to give accessibility to our dataset which further can be explored and used for building or fine-tuning machine learning and deep learning models for the automatic detection of irrigated fields using satellite imagery.

Flood modeling prior to the instrumental era reveals limited magnitude of 1931 Yangtze flood,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00908-1,2025-01-19,The global flood risk urges an improved understanding of flood magnitude and its mechanism, which needs insights from pre-instrumental flood investigations. Due to data scarcity, reconstructing pre-instrumental flood magnitudes relies on statistical downscaling, failing to capture nonlinear and dynamic characteristics. We developed a dynamical approach, NorESM-WRF-SWAT, integrating a global climate, a regional, and a hydrologic model to investigate the 1931 Yangtze River flood (the deadliest in the world) and compared it with the 1998’s. Through validation, our method outperforms the statistical method in simulating precipitations and river discharges. For the first time, we presented detailed insights into the intensity and duration of the 1931 flood, revealing a smaller magnitude but associated with an amplified loss, likely due to social vulnerability and reduced societal resilience compared to the 1998’s. While successful simulation can be interfered with by model variability, our dynamical method shows promise for simulating pre-instrumental flood and building a long-term pre-instrumental-hydrology database.

Emergent constraints on global soil moisture projections under climate change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02024-7,2025-01-20,Surface soil moisture is projected to decrease under global warming. Such projections are mostly based on climate models, which show large uncertainty (i.e., inter-model spread) partly due to inadequate observational constraint. Here we identify strong physically-based emergent relationships between soil moisture change (2070–2099 minus 1980–2014) and recent air temperature and precipitation trends across an ensemble of climate models. We extend the commonly used univariate Emergent Constraints to a bivariate method and use observed temperature and precipitation trends to constrain global soil moisture changes. Our results show that the bivariate emergent constraints can reduce soil moisture change uncertainty by 7.87%, which is four times more effective than traditional temperature-based univariate constraints. The bivariate emergent constraints change the sign of soil moisture change from negative to positive for semi-arid, dry sub-humid and humid regions and global land as a whole, but exacerbates the drying trend in arid and hyper-arid regions.

Increasing certainty in projected local extreme precipitation change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56235-9,2025-01-20,The latest climate models project widely varying magnitudes of future extreme precipitation changes, thus impeding effective adaptation planning. Many observational constraints have been proposed to reduce the uncertainty of these projections at global to sub-continental scales, but adaptation generally requires detailed, local scale information. Here, we present a temperature-based adaptative emergent constraint strategy combined with data aggregation that reduces the error variance of projected end-of-century changes in annual extremes of daily precipitation under a high emissions scenario by &gt;20% across most areas of the world. These improved projections could benefit nearly 90% of the world’s population by permitting better impact assessment and adaptation planning at local levels. Our physically motivated strategy, which considers the thermodynamic and dynamic components of projected extreme precipitation change, exploits the link between global warming and the thermodynamic component of extreme precipitation. Rigorous cross-validation provides strong evidence of its reliability in constraining local extreme precipitation projections.

Dichotomy retreat and aqueous alteration on Noachian Mars recorded in highland remnants,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01634-8,2025-01-20,The Mawrth Vallis region is a plateau situated on the highland side of Mars’ hemispheric dichotomy boundary. It has a &gt;200-m-thick phyllosilicate-bearing stratigraphic succession that indicates extensive aqueous alteration between 4.1 Ga and 3.7 Ga, during the Noachian Period. In addition, thousands of kilometre-scale isolated mounds in the lowlands north and west of Mawrth Vallis have been identified. Here we use geomorphological and spectroscopic analyses to show that the mounds are erosional remnants that formed through retreat of the highland plateau in the Noachian. Consequently, the escarpment that marks the surface expression of the dichotomy must have receded south-southeast by hundreds of kilometres in this area. Lateral and stratigraphic geochemical variation in the mounds show that widespread, multiphase aqueous alteration occurred in situ across this region in surface and subsurface environments. The mound succession is underlain by a pyroxene-rich unit that represents unaltered material below the regional phyllosilicate-bearing sequence and is unconformably overlain by a thin capping unit that marks the end of large-scale regional aqueous activity. Thus, the mounds contain a stratigraphic record of the onset, evolution and cessation of Noachian aqueous conditions in this region, detailing the environment and climate of Mars at its most habitable.

Projected runoff declines from plant physiological effects on precipitation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00361-z,2025-01-20,The impact of plants on runoff under high atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is a major uncertainty for future water resources. Theory and Earth system models (ESMs) suggest that stricter plant stomatal regulation under high CO<sub>2</sub> will reduce transpiration, potentially boosting runoff. Yet, across a 12-member ensemble of idealized ESM simulations that isolate plant responses to CO<sub>2</sub>, we show that lower transpiration robustly enhances runoff over only 5% of modelled global land area. Precipitation changes are five times more important than transpiration changes in driving runoff responses and are a significant signal of CO<sub>2</sub> physiological forcing over 31–57% of land areas across models. Crucially, ESMs largely disagree on where physiologically forced precipitation changes occur but agree that plant responses in most locations are as likely to reduce runoff as increase it. These results imply that large model uncertainties in precipitation responses, rather than transpiration responses, explain why ESMs disagree on plant physiologically driven runoff changes.

Measurements of groundwater, hydrodynamics, and sand characteristics at a dissipative sea turtle nesting beach,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04455-5,2025-01-21,Beach groundwater and nearshore hydrodynamic data were collected during a field experiment along two dissipative beach transects on Galveston Island, Texas, in the fall of 2023. The monitored beaches serve as nesting habitat for the critically endangered Kemp’s ridley sea turtle. Conditions ranged from calm to stormy, with two storms occurring during the experiment, inundating the entire beach up to the dune toe. Collected hydrodynamic data include readings from pressure loggers submerged in the foreshore and mounted in groundwater wells in the backshore, data from two wave buoys about 1.5 km offshore, and GoPro timestacks of the instantaneous waterline (wave runup). Other collected data include bathymetry and topography surveys, subsurface temperature and moisture content readings, and sediment characteristics. This comprehensive dataset can be used to (1) study relevant beach inundation and groundwater processes, including their effect on the local ecosystem (e.g., repeated flooding of sea turtle nests), (2) study the propagation of nearshore hydrodynamic processes into the beach matrix and groundwater table, and (3) validate existing beach groundwater models.

The dataset covers the basins of the Laurentian Great Lakes and the Ottawa River and extends over the period 2001–2018. The data consist of all variables (hourly fluxes and state variables) related to the water balance of GEM-Hydro’s land-surface scheme (including precipitation, surface and sub-surface runoff, drainage, evaporation, snow water equivalent, soil moisture…) and mean daily streamflow at 212 gauge locations. These outputs were simulated with a calibrated version of the GEM-Hydro model that was run in open-loop mode (no assimilation) and driven with atmospheric forcings coming from ECCC’s Canadian Surface Reanalysis version 2.1.

Multifaceted changes in water availability with a warmer climate,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00913-4,2025-01-24,Climate warming alters spatial and seasonal patterns of surface water availability (P-E), affecting runoff and terrestrial water storage. However, a comprehensive assessment of these changes across various hydroclimates remains lacking. We develop a multi-model ensemble approach to classify global terrestrial hydroclimate into four distinct regimes based on the mean and seasonality of P-E. P-E is projected to become increasingly variable across space and time. Wet regions with low and high seasonality are likely to experience more concentrated increases in wet-season runoff by up to 20%, highlighting potential increases in flood-related vulnerability. Low-seasonality regions exhibit faster wet-season increases and more rapid dry-season decreases in soil moisture, heightening the likelihood of water scarcity and drought. Conversely, dry regions with high seasonality are less sensitive to climate change. These findings underscore the multifaceted impacts of climate change on global water resources, necessitating the need for tailored adaptation strategies for different hydroclimate regimes.

However, temporal gaps within these datasets and the lack of TWSA observations prior to 2002 limit our understanding of long-term freshwater variability. In this study, we develop GR<i>Ai</i>CE, a set of four global monthly TWSA reconstructions from 1984 to 2021 at 0.5° spatial resolution, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) neural networks.

Shifted dominant flood drivers of an alpine glacierized catchment in the Tianshan region revealed through interpretable deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00918-z,2025-01-26,The Kumalak River, a typical alpine glacierized catchment in the Tianshan region, experiences complex flooding driven by glacier meltwater, snowmelt, and rainfall. However, the mechanisms driving these processes under climate change remain unclear. To address this, a SWAT-Glacier hydrological model and a degree–day factor model were used for snowmelt, glacier meltwater, and rainfall calculations. Two Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models (LSTM-SG and LSTM-DDF) were developed using these inputs, and additive decomposition and integrated gradient methods were applied to interpret flood mechanisms. Glacier meltwater was found to dominate annual maximum flood (AMF) events, while snowmelt drove annual spring maximum flood (AMFSp) events. For AMF events (1960–2018), contributions were 10.01–12.21% from snowmelt, 60.49–60.92% from glacier meltwater, and 26.86–29.50% from rainfall. For AMFSp events (1961–2018), contributions were 48.49–56.08% from snowmelt, 16.12–22.08% from glacier meltwater, and 27.79–29.42% from rainfall. These findings provide critical insights for enhancing flood prediction and optimizing water resource management.

Impacts of irrigation expansion on moist-heat stress based on IRRMIP results,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56356-1,2025-01-26,Irrigation rapidly expanded during the 20<sup><i>t</i><i>h</i></sup> century, affecting climate via water, energy, and biogeochemical changes. Previous assessments of these effects predominantly relied on a single Earth System Model, and therefore suffered from structural model uncertainties. Here we quantify the impacts of historical irrigation expansion on climate by analysing simulation results from six Earth system models participating in the Irrigation Model Intercomparison Project (IRRMIP). Results show that irrigation expansion causes a rapid increase in irrigation water withdrawal, which leads to less frequent 2-meter air temperature heat extremes across heavily irrigated areas (≥4 times less likely). However, due to the irrigation-induced increase in air humidity, the cooling effect of irrigation expansion on moist-heat stress is less pronounced or even reversed, depending on the heat stress metric. In summary, this study indicates that irrigation deployment is not an efficient adaptation measure to escalating human heat stress under climate change, calling for carefully dealing with the increased exposure of local people to moist-heat stress.

For AMF events (1960–2018), contributions were 10.01–12.21% from snowmelt, 60.49–60.92% from glacier meltwater, and 26.86–29.50% from rainfall. For AMFSp events (1961–2018), contributions were 48.49–56.08% from snowmelt, 16.12–22.08% from glacier meltwater, and 27.79–29.42% from rainfall. These findings provide critical insights for enhancing flood prediction and optimizing water resource management.

Impacts of irrigation expansion on moist-heat stress based on IRRMIP results,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56356-1,2025-01-26,Irrigation rapidly expanded during the 20<sup><i>t</i><i>h</i></sup> century, affecting climate via water, energy, and biogeochemical changes. Previous assessments of these effects predominantly relied on a single Earth System Model, and therefore suffered from structural model uncertainties. Here we quantify the impacts of historical irrigation expansion on climate by analysing simulation results from six Earth system models participating in the Irrigation Model Intercomparison Project (IRRMIP). Results show that irrigation expansion causes a rapid increase in irrigation water withdrawal, which leads to less frequent 2-meter air temperature heat extremes across heavily irrigated areas (≥4 times less likely). However, due to the irrigation-induced increase in air humidity, the cooling effect of irrigation expansion on moist-heat stress is less pronounced or even reversed, depending on the heat stress metric. In summary, this study indicates that irrigation deployment is not an efficient adaptation measure to escalating human heat stress under climate change, calling for carefully dealing with the increased exposure of local people to moist-heat stress.

Increasing certainty in projected local extreme precipitation change,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56235-9,2025-01-20,The latest climate models project widely varying magnitudes of future extreme precipitation changes, thus impeding effective adaptation planning. Many observational constraints have been proposed to reduce the uncertainty of these projections at global to sub-continental scales, but adaptation generally requires detailed, local scale information. Here, we present a temperature-based adaptative emergent constraint strategy combined with data aggregation that reduces the error variance of projected end-of-century changes in annual extremes of daily precipitation under a high emissions scenario by &gt;20% across most areas of the world. These improved projections could benefit nearly 90% of the world’s population by permitting better impact assessment and adaptation planning at local levels. Our physically motivated strategy, which considers the thermodynamic and dynamic components of projected extreme precipitation change, exploits the link between global warming and the thermodynamic component of extreme precipitation. Rigorous cross-validation provides strong evidence of its reliability in constraining local extreme precipitation projections.

Dichotomy retreat and aqueous alteration on Noachian Mars recorded in highland remnants,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01634-8,2025-01-20,The Mawrth Vallis region is a plateau situated on the highland side of Mars’ hemispheric dichotomy boundary. It has a &gt;200-m-thick phyllosilicate-bearing stratigraphic succession that indicates extensive aqueous alteration between 4.1 Ga and 3.7 Ga, during the Noachian Period. In addition, thousands of kilometre-scale isolated mounds in the lowlands north and west of Mawrth Vallis have been identified. Here we use geomorphological and spectroscopic analyses to show that the mounds are erosional remnants that formed through retreat of the highland plateau in the Noachian. Consequently, the escarpment that marks the surface expression of the dichotomy must have receded south-southeast by hundreds of kilometres in this area. Lateral and stratigraphic geochemical variation in the mounds show that widespread, multiphase aqueous alteration occurred in situ across this region in surface and subsurface environments. The mound succession is underlain by a pyroxene-rich unit that represents unaltered material below the regional phyllosilicate-bearing sequence and is unconformably overlain by a thin capping unit that marks the end of large-scale regional aqueous activity. Thus, the mounds contain a stratigraphic record of the onset, evolution and cessation of Noachian aqueous conditions in this region, detailing the environment and climate of Mars at its most habitable.

Projected runoff declines from plant physiological effects on precipitation,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00361-z,2025-01-20,The impact of plants on runoff under high atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is a major uncertainty for future water resources. Theory and Earth system models (ESMs) suggest that stricter plant stomatal regulation under high CO<sub>2</sub> will reduce transpiration, potentially boosting runoff. Yet, across a 12-member ensemble of idealized ESM simulations that isolate plant responses to CO<sub>2</sub>, we show that lower transpiration robustly enhances runoff over only 5% of modelled global land area. Precipitation changes are five times more important than transpiration changes in driving runoff responses and are a significant signal of CO<sub>2</sub> physiological forcing over 31–57% of land areas across models. Crucially, ESMs largely disagree on where physiologically forced precipitation changes occur but agree that plant responses in most locations are as likely to reduce runoff as increase it. These results imply that large model uncertainties in precipitation responses, rather than transpiration responses, explain why ESMs disagree on plant physiologically driven runoff changes.

Measurements of groundwater, hydrodynamics, and sand characteristics at a dissipative sea turtle nesting beach,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04455-5,2025-01-21,Beach groundwater and nearshore hydrodynamic data were collected during a field experiment along two dissipative beach transects on Galveston Island, Texas, in the fall of 2023. The monitored beaches serve as nesting habitat for the critically endangered Kemp’s ridley sea turtle. Conditions ranged from calm to stormy, with two storms occurring during the experiment, inundating the entire beach up to the dune toe. Collected hydrodynamic data include readings from pressure loggers submerged in the foreshore and mounted in groundwater wells in the backshore, data from two wave buoys about 1.5 km offshore, and GoPro timestacks of the instantaneous waterline (wave runup). Other collected data include bathymetry and topography surveys, subsurface temperature and moisture content readings, and sediment characteristics. This comprehensive dataset can be used to (1) study relevant beach inundation and groundwater processes, including their effect on the local ecosystem (e.g., repeated flooding of sea turtle nests), (2) study the propagation of nearshore hydrodynamic processes into the beach matrix and groundwater table, and (3) validate existing beach groundwater models.

The dataset covers the basins of the Laurentian Great Lakes and the Ottawa River and extends over the period 2001–2018. The data consist of all variables (hourly fluxes and state variables) related to the water balance of GEM-Hydro’s land-surface scheme (including precipitation, surface and sub-surface runoff, drainage, evaporation, snow water equivalent, soil moisture…) and mean daily streamflow at 212 gauge locations. These outputs were simulated with a calibrated version of the GEM-Hydro model that was run in open-loop mode (no assimilation) and driven with atmospheric forcings coming from ECCC’s Canadian Surface Reanalysis version 2.1. GEM-Hydro achieves satisfactory simulations of various hydrologic variables when compared to reference datasets. This dataset can be used for example to drive any routing model, compute climatologies or statistics for different hydrologic variables and study their variability as a function of the local geo-morphology, etc.

Multifaceted changes in water availability with a warmer climate,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00913-4,2025-01-24,Climate warming alters spatial and seasonal patterns of surface water availability (P-E), affecting runoff and terrestrial water storage. However, a comprehensive assessment of these changes across various hydroclimates remains lacking. We develop a multi-model ensemble approach to classify global terrestrial hydroclimate into four distinct regimes based on the mean and seasonality of P-E. P-E is projected to become increasingly variable across space and time. Wet regions with low and high seasonality are likely to experience more concentrated increases in wet-season runoff by up to 20%, highlighting potential increases in flood-related vulnerability. Low-seasonality regions exhibit faster wet-season increases and more rapid dry-season decreases in soil moisture, heightening the likelihood of water scarcity and drought. Conversely, dry regions with high seasonality are less sensitive to climate change. These findings underscore the multifaceted impacts of climate change on global water resources, necessitating the need for tailored adaptation strategies for different hydroclimate regimes.

GRAiCE: reconstructing terrestrial water storage anomalies with recurrent neural networks,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04403-3,2025-01-25,The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on (GRACE-FO) missions have provided estimates of Terrestrial Water Storage Anomalies (TWSA) since 2002, enabling the monitoring of global hydrological changes. However, temporal gaps within these datasets and the lack of TWSA observations prior to 2002 limit our understanding of long-term freshwater variability. In this study, we develop GR<i>Ai</i>CE, a set of four global monthly TWSA reconstructions from 1984 to 2021 at 0.5° spatial resolution, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) neural networks. Our models accurately reproduce GRACE/GRACE-FO observations at the global scale and effectively capture the impacts of climate extremes. Overall, GR<i>Ai</i>CE outperforms a previous reference TWSA reconstruction in predicting observed TWSA and provides reliable water budget estimates at the river basin scale. By generating long-term continuous TWSA time series, GR<i>Ai</i>CE will offer valuable insights into the impacts of climate variability and change on freshwater resources.

Shifted dominant flood drivers of an alpine glacierized catchment in the Tianshan region revealed through interpretable deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00918-z,2025-01-26,The Kumalak River, a typical alpine glacierized catchment in the Tianshan region, experiences complex flooding driven by glacier meltwater, snowmelt, and rainfall. However, the mechanisms driving these processes under climate change remain unclear.

Our findings deepen perception into the complex interactions between precipitation, land surface processes, and climate change, offering valuable implications for future water resource management and hydrological modeling.

Chronic nitrogen legacy in the aquifers of China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02016-7,2025-01-28,About half of the global drinking water comes from groundwater, yet groundwater quality is threatened by high nitrate concentrations globally. Our understanding of groundwater nitrate concentrations is often limited by inaccessibility of groundwater and scarcity of nitrate data in groundwater. Here we used machine learning and decision tree-heatmap analysis by compiling nitrate concentrations and isotope data from 4047 groundwater sites across China to understand their dynamics and drivers across gradients of geographical, climate, and human factors. Results show that nitrate concentrations vary substantially over depth and are generally lower in deeper groundwater, indicating potentially higher nitrate removal rates according to nitrate isotopic pattern such as denitrification at depth. At similar groundwater aquifer depths, nitrate concentrations are highest in urban regions with high population density. In addition, nitrate concentrations are generally higher in arid northern China than humid southern China. Interestingly, while groundwater nitrate concentrations are lower at deeper depths, slow groundwater flow also indicates prolonged nitrogen legacy. Although there has been an overall decline in groundwater nitrogen pollution in China since 2016, persistent pollution has lingered. Future strategies for groundwater quality protection in China should address the long-term legacy of nitrate in different aquifers and rising nitrogen levels in groundwater.

Here we address this by introducing a quantitative metric, average daily fraction of precipitation transformed into terrestrial water storage, providing an important advancement into the dynamics of water storage by utilizing the enhanced terrestrial water storage statistical reconstruction method and water storage data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites and their follow-on mission. This study reveals that approximately 64% of land precipitation contributes to terrestrial water storage in global 121 river basins from 2002 to 2021, with evident variations observed across different climatic and geographical regions. Our findings deepen perception into the complex interactions between precipitation, land surface processes, and climate change, offering valuable implications for future water resource management and hydrological modeling.

Chronic nitrogen legacy in the aquifers of China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02016-7,2025-01-28,About half of the global drinking water comes from groundwater, yet groundwater quality is threatened by high nitrate concentrations globally. Our understanding of groundwater nitrate concentrations is often limited by inaccessibility of groundwater and scarcity of nitrate data in groundwater. Here we used machine learning and decision tree-heatmap analysis by compiling nitrate concentrations and isotope data from 4047 groundwater sites across China to understand their dynamics and drivers across gradients of geographical, climate, and human factors. Results show that nitrate concentrations vary substantially over depth and are generally lower in deeper groundwater, indicating potentially higher nitrate removal rates according to nitrate isotopic pattern such as denitrification at depth. At similar groundwater aquifer depths, nitrate concentrations are highest in urban regions with high population density. In addition, nitrate concentrations are generally higher in arid northern China than humid southern China. Interestingly, while groundwater nitrate concentrations are lower at deeper depths, slow groundwater flow also indicates prolonged nitrogen legacy. Although there has been an overall decline in groundwater nitrogen pollution in China since 2016, persistent pollution has lingered. Future strategies for groundwater quality protection in China should address the long-term legacy of nitrate in different aquifers and rising nitrogen levels in groundwater.

Australian water quality trends over two decades show deterioration in the Great Barrier Reef region and recovery in the Murray-Darling Basin,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02044-3,2025-01-29,Understanding river water quality trajectories and drivers is crucial for effective environmental management. Here we present a comprehensive nation-wide water quality trend assessment across Australia with 287 catchments from 2000 to 2019. About half of the catchments show significant trends in the flow-normalised concentration for each parameter analysed. Most of these significant trends are due to changes in concentration-flow relationships rather than long-term trends in flow. Two of Australia’s major river basins show opposing regional patterns in their significant trends. The North East Coast, which largely flows into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, has increasing phosphorus and sediments. This potentially reflects lagged effects of increasing land clearing and fertilisation since 1960s, while land improvement in the region has not yet demonstrated improvement on water quality. The Murray-Darling Basin has decreasing salinity, phosphorus, and sediment, likely driven by effects of a region-scale salinity management interventions and a prolonged drought on catchment processes.

Human-induced water loss potentially threatens sustainable development of sandy regions in China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02046-1,2025-01-30,Water is indispensable for sustainable socioeconomic development, especially in China’s sandy regions. Despite existing studies in sandy regions, the drivers of changes in total water storage and their potential impacts remain inadequately understood. Here we found a 55.97 billion m³ net loss in total water storage from 2002 to 2023 by integrating multiple datasets. Water loss was primarily attributed to increased farmland irrigation (49.56 billion m³) and ecological restoration (37.04 billion m³). In the coming 40 years, water supply capacity will decrease by up to 6.54% and 19.07% under low and high emission scenarios, respectively, requiring reductions in human water consumption of 60% to 135%. This depletion potentially threatens both regional sustainability and national ecological security. This study calls for urgent scientific regulations on water resources, including strict control of local consumption and enhancement of supply capacity.

Global water gaps under future warming levels,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56517-2,2025-01-30,Understanding the impacts of climate change on water resources is crucial for developing effective adaptation strategies. We quantify “water gaps”, or unsustainable water use – the shortfall where water demand exceeds supply, resulting in scarcity. We quantify baseline and future water gaps using a multi-model analysis that incorporates two plausible future warming scenarios. The baseline global water gap stands at 457.9 km<sup>3</sup>/yr, with projections indicating an increase of 26.5 km<sup>3</sup>/yr (+5.8%) and 67.4 km<sup>3</sup>/yr (+14.7%) under 1.5 °C and 3 °C warming scenarios, respectively. These projections highlight the uneven impact of warming levels on water gaps, emphasizing the need for continued climate change mitigation to alleviate stress on water resources. Our results also underscore the unequal adaptation needs across countries and basins, influenced by varying warming scenarios, with important regional differences and model variability complicating future projections. Robust water management strategies are needed to tackle the escalating water scarcity caused by global warming.

Hydrologic outputs generated over the Great Lakes with a calibrated version of the GEM-Hydro model,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04409-x,2025-01-22,This dataset contains outputs from a calibrated version of the GEM-Hydro model developed at Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and is available on the Federated Research Data Repository. The dataset covers the basins of the Laurentian Great Lakes and the Ottawa River and extends over the period 2001–2018. The data consist of all variables (hourly fluxes and state variables) related to the water balance of GEM-Hydro’s land-surface scheme (including precipitation, surface and sub-surface runoff, drainage, evaporation, snow water equivalent, soil moisture…) and mean daily streamflow at 212 gauge locations. These outputs were simulated with a calibrated version of the GEM-Hydro model that was run in open-loop mode (no assimilation) and driven with atmospheric forcings coming from ECCC’s Canadian Surface Reanalysis version 2.1. GEM-Hydro achieves satisfactory simulations of various hydrologic variables when compared to reference datasets. This dataset can be used for example to drive any routing model, compute climatologies or statistics for different hydrologic variables and study their variability as a function of the local geo-morphology, etc.

Multifaceted changes in water availability with a warmer climate,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00913-4,2025-01-24,Climate warming alters spatial and seasonal patterns of surface water availability (P-E), affecting runoff and terrestrial water storage. However, a comprehensive assessment of these changes across various hydroclimates remains lacking. We develop a multi-model ensemble approach to classify global terrestrial hydroclimate into four distinct regimes based on the mean and seasonality of P-E. P-E is projected to become increasingly variable across space and time. Wet regions with low and high seasonality are likely to experience more concentrated increases in wet-season runoff by up to 20%, highlighting potential increases in flood-related vulnerability. Low-seasonality regions exhibit faster wet-season increases and more rapid dry-season decreases in soil moisture, heightening the likelihood of water scarcity and drought. Conversely, dry regions with high seasonality are less sensitive to climate change. These findings underscore the multifaceted impacts of climate change on global water resources, necessitating the need for tailored adaptation strategies for different hydroclimate regimes.

GRAiCE: reconstructing terrestrial water storage anomalies with recurrent neural networks,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04403-3,2025-01-25,The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on (GRACE-FO) missions have provided estimates of Terrestrial Water Storage Anomalies (TWSA) since 2002, enabling the monitoring of global hydrological changes. However, temporal gaps within these datasets and the lack of TWSA observations prior to 2002 limit our understanding of long-term freshwater variability. In this study, we develop GR<i>Ai</i>CE, a set of four global monthly TWSA reconstructions from 1984 to 2021 at 0.5° spatial resolution, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) neural networks. Our models accurately reproduce GRACE/GRACE-FO observations at the global scale and effectively capture the impacts of climate extremes. Overall, GR<i>Ai</i>CE outperforms a previous reference TWSA reconstruction in predicting observed TWSA and provides reliable water budget estimates at the river basin scale. By generating long-term continuous TWSA time series, GR<i>Ai</i>CE will offer valuable insights into the impacts of climate variability and change on freshwater resources.

Shifted dominant flood drivers of an alpine glacierized catchment in the Tianshan region revealed through interpretable deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00918-z,2025-01-26,The Kumalak River, a typical alpine glacierized catchment in the Tianshan region, experiences complex flooding driven by glacier meltwater, snowmelt, and rainfall. However, the mechanisms driving these processes under climate change remain unclear. To address this, a SWAT-Glacier hydrological model and a degree–day factor model were used for snowmelt, glacier meltwater, and rainfall calculations. Two Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models (LSTM-SG and LSTM-DDF) were developed using these inputs, and additive decomposition and integrated gradient methods were applied to interpret flood mechanisms. Glacier meltwater was found to dominate annual maximum flood (AMF) events, while snowmelt drove annual spring maximum flood (AMFSp) events. For AMF events (1960–2018), contributions were 10.01–12.21% from snowmelt, 60.49–60.92% from glacier meltwater, and 26.86–29.50% from rainfall. For AMFSp events (1961–2018), contributions were 48.49–56.08% from snowmelt, 16.12–22.08% from glacier meltwater, and 27.79–29.42% from rainfall. These findings provide critical insights for enhancing flood prediction and optimizing water resource management.

Impacts of irrigation expansion on moist-heat stress based on IRRMIP results,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56356-1,2025-01-26,Irrigation rapidly expanded during the 20<sup><i>t</i><i>h</i></sup> century, affecting climate via water, energy, and biogeochemical changes. Previous assessments of these effects predominantly relied on a single Earth System Model, and therefore suffered from structural model uncertainties. Here we quantify the impacts of historical irrigation expansion on climate by analysing simulation results from six Earth system models participating in the Irrigation Model Intercomparison Project (IRRMIP). Results show that irrigation expansion causes a rapid increase in irrigation water withdrawal, which leads to less frequent 2-meter air temperature heat extremes across heavily irrigated areas (≥4 times less likely). However, due to the irrigation-induced increase in air humidity, the cooling effect of irrigation expansion on moist-heat stress is less pronounced or even reversed, depending on the heat stress metric. In summary, this study indicates that irrigation deployment is not an efficient adaptation measure to escalating human heat stress under climate change, calling for carefully dealing with the increased exposure of local people to moist-heat stress.

For AMFSp events (1961–2018), contributions were 48.49–56.08% from snowmelt, 16.12–22.08% from glacier meltwater, and 27.79–29.42% from rainfall. These findings provide critical insights for enhancing flood prediction and optimizing water resource management.

Impacts of irrigation expansion on moist-heat stress based on IRRMIP results,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56356-1,2025-01-26,Irrigation rapidly expanded during the 20<sup><i>t</i><i>h</i></sup> century, affecting climate via water, energy, and biogeochemical changes. Previous assessments of these effects predominantly relied on a single Earth System Model, and therefore suffered from structural model uncertainties. Here we quantify the impacts of historical irrigation expansion on climate by analysing simulation results from six Earth system models participating in the Irrigation Model Intercomparison Project (IRRMIP). Results show that irrigation expansion causes a rapid increase in irrigation water withdrawal, which leads to less frequent 2-meter air temperature heat extremes across heavily irrigated areas (≥4 times less likely). However, due to the irrigation-induced increase in air humidity, the cooling effect of irrigation expansion on moist-heat stress is less pronounced or even reversed, depending on the heat stress metric. In summary, this study indicates that irrigation deployment is not an efficient adaptation measure to escalating human heat stress under climate change, calling for carefully dealing with the increased exposure of local people to moist-heat stress.

Over 60% precipitation transformed into terrestrial water storage in global river basins from 2002 to 2021,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01967-7,2025-01-27,The crucial role of precipitation as a primary driver for terrestrial water cycle is well-established. However, quantifying the transformation of daily precipitation into terrestrial water storage remains a challenge. Here we address this by introducing a quantitative metric, average daily fraction of precipitation transformed into terrestrial water storage, providing an important advancement into the dynamics of water storage by utilizing the enhanced terrestrial water storage statistical reconstruction method and water storage data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites and their follow-on mission. This study reveals that approximately 64% of land precipitation contributes to terrestrial water storage in global 121 river basins from 2002 to 2021, with evident variations observed across different climatic and geographical regions. Our findings deepen perception into the complex interactions between precipitation, land surface processes, and climate change, offering valuable implications for future water resource management and hydrological modeling.

Chronic nitrogen legacy in the aquifers of China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02016-7,2025-01-28,About half of the global drinking water comes from groundwater, yet groundwater quality is threatened by high nitrate concentrations globally. Our understanding of groundwater nitrate concentrations is often limited by inaccessibility of groundwater and scarcity of nitrate data in groundwater. Here we used machine learning and decision tree-heatmap analysis by compiling nitrate concentrations and isotope data from 4047 groundwater sites across China to understand their dynamics and drivers across gradients of geographical, climate, and human factors. Results show that nitrate concentrations vary substantially over depth and are generally lower in deeper groundwater, indicating potentially higher nitrate removal rates according to nitrate isotopic pattern such as denitrification at depth. At similar groundwater aquifer depths, nitrate concentrations are highest in urban regions with high population density. In addition, nitrate concentrations are generally higher in arid northern China than humid southern China. Interestingly, while groundwater nitrate concentrations are lower at deeper depths, slow groundwater flow also indicates prolonged nitrogen legacy. Although there has been an overall decline in groundwater nitrogen pollution in China since 2016, persistent pollution has lingered. Future strategies for groundwater quality protection in China should address the long-term legacy of nitrate in different aquifers and rising nitrogen levels in groundwater.

Australian water quality trends over two decades show deterioration in the Great Barrier Reef region and recovery in the Murray-Darling Basin,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02044-3,2025-01-29,Understanding river water quality trajectories and drivers is crucial for effective environmental management. Here we present a comprehensive nation-wide water quality trend assessment across Australia with 287 catchments from 2000 to 2019. About half of the catchments show significant trends in the flow-normalised concentration for each parameter analysed. Most of these significant trends are due to changes in concentration-flow relationships rather than long-term trends in flow. Two of Australia’s major river basins show opposing regional patterns in their significant trends. The North East Coast, which largely flows into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, has increasing phosphorus and sediments. This potentially reflects lagged effects of increasing land clearing and fertilisation since 1960s, while land improvement in the region has not yet demonstrated improvement on water quality. The Murray-Darling Basin has decreasing salinity, phosphorus, and sediment, likely driven by effects of a region-scale salinity management interventions and a prolonged drought on catchment processes.

Human-induced water loss potentially threatens sustainable development of sandy regions in China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02046-1,2025-01-30,Water is indispensable for sustainable socioeconomic development, especially in China’s sandy regions. Despite existing studies in sandy regions, the drivers of changes in total water storage and their potential impacts remain inadequately understood. Here we found a 55.97 billion m³ net loss in total water storage from 2002 to 2023 by integrating multiple datasets. Water loss was primarily attributed to increased farmland irrigation (49.56 billion m³) and ecological restoration (37.04 billion m³). In the coming 40 years, water supply capacity will decrease by up to 6.54% and 19.07% under low and high emission scenarios, respectively, requiring reductions in human water consumption of 60% to 135%. This depletion potentially threatens both regional sustainability and national ecological security. This study calls for urgent scientific regulations on water resources, including strict control of local consumption and enhancement of supply capacity.

Global water gaps under future warming levels,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56517-2,2025-01-30,Understanding the impacts of climate change on water resources is crucial for developing effective adaptation strategies. We quantify “water gaps”, or unsustainable water use – the shortfall where water demand exceeds supply, resulting in scarcity. We quantify baseline and future water gaps using a multi-model analysis that incorporates two plausible future warming scenarios. The baseline global water gap stands at 457.9 km<sup>3</sup>/yr, with projections indicating an increase of 26.5 km<sup>3</sup>/yr (+5.8%) and 67.4 km<sup>3</sup>/yr (+14.7%) under 1.5 °C and 3 °C warming scenarios, respectively. These projections highlight the uneven impact of warming levels on water gaps, emphasizing the need for continued climate change mitigation to alleviate stress on water resources. Our results also underscore the unequal adaptation needs across countries and basins, influenced by varying warming scenarios, with important regional differences and model variability complicating future projections. Robust water management strategies are needed to tackle the escalating water scarcity caused by global warming.

Bias-corrected high-resolution temperature and precipitation projections for Canada,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04396-z,2025-02-01,High-resolution precipitation and temperature projections are indispensable for informed decision-making, risk assessment, and planning. Here, we have developed an extensive database (SPQM-CMIP6-CAN) of high-resolution (0.1°) precipitation and temperature projections extending till 2100 at a daily scale for Canada. We employed a novel Semi-Parametric Quantile Mapping (SPQM) methodology to bias-correct the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase-6 (CMIP6) projections for four Shared Socio-economic Pathways. SPQM is simple, yet robust, in reproducing the observed marginal properties, trends, and variability according to future scenarios, while maintaining a smooth transition from observations to projected simulations. The SPQM-CMIP6-CAN database encompasses 693 simulations derived from 34 diverse climate models for precipitation. Similarly, for temperature projections, our database comprises 581 simulations from 27 climate models. These projections are valuable for hydrological, environmental, and ecological studies, offering a comprehensive resource for analyses within these domains. Furthermore, these projections serve as a vital tool for the quantification of uncertainties arising from climate models, their variant configurations, and future scenarios.

Multifaceted changes in water availability with a warmer climate,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00913-4,2025-01-24,Climate warming alters spatial and seasonal patterns of surface water availability (P-E), affecting runoff and terrestrial water storage. However, a comprehensive assessment of these changes across various hydroclimates remains lacking. We develop a multi-model ensemble approach to classify global terrestrial hydroclimate into four distinct regimes based on the mean and seasonality of P-E. P-E is projected to become increasingly variable across space and time. Wet regions with low and high seasonality are likely to experience more concentrated increases in wet-season runoff by up to 20%, highlighting potential increases in flood-related vulnerability. Low-seasonality regions exhibit faster wet-season increases and more rapid dry-season decreases in soil moisture, heightening the likelihood of water scarcity and drought. Conversely, dry regions with high seasonality are less sensitive to climate change. These findings underscore the multifaceted impacts of climate change on global water resources, necessitating the need for tailored adaptation strategies for different hydroclimate regimes.

GRAiCE: reconstructing terrestrial water storage anomalies with recurrent neural networks,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04403-3,2025-01-25,The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on (GRACE-FO) missions have provided estimates of Terrestrial Water Storage Anomalies (TWSA) since 2002, enabling the monitoring of global hydrological changes. However, temporal gaps within these datasets and the lack of TWSA observations prior to 2002 limit our understanding of long-term freshwater variability. In this study, we develop GR<i>Ai</i>CE, a set of four global monthly TWSA reconstructions from 1984 to 2021 at 0.5° spatial resolution, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) neural networks. Our models accurately reproduce GRACE/GRACE-FO observations at the global scale and effectively capture the impacts of climate extremes. Overall, GR<i>Ai</i>CE outperforms a previous reference TWSA reconstruction in predicting observed TWSA and provides reliable water budget estimates at the river basin scale. By generating long-term continuous TWSA time series, GR<i>Ai</i>CE will offer valuable insights into the impacts of climate variability and change on freshwater resources.

Shifted dominant flood drivers of an alpine glacierized catchment in the Tianshan region revealed through interpretable deep learning,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00918-z,2025-01-26,The Kumalak River, a typical alpine glacierized catchment in the Tianshan region, experiences complex flooding driven by glacier meltwater, snowmelt, and rainfall. However, the mechanisms driving these processes under climate change remain unclear. To address this, a SWAT-Glacier hydrological model and a degree–day factor model were used for snowmelt, glacier meltwater, and rainfall calculations. Two Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models (LSTM-SG and LSTM-DDF) were developed using these inputs, and additive decomposition and integrated gradient methods were applied to interpret flood mechanisms. Glacier meltwater was found to dominate annual maximum flood (AMF) events, while snowmelt drove annual spring maximum flood (AMFSp) events. For AMF events (1960–2018), contributions were 10.01–12.21% from snowmelt, 60.49–60.92% from glacier meltwater, and 26.86–29.50% from rainfall.

The hidden influence of terrestrial groundwater on salt marsh function and resilience,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00384-6,2025-02-03,Salt marshes are hotspots of nutrient processing and carbon sequestration. So far, studies addressing spatiotemporal variability in and drivers of salt marsh biogeochemical function, carbon storage and resilience have focused on ocean-driven surface hydrologic influences, neglecting effects of terrestrial hydrology through subsurface connections. Here we evaluate drivers of salt marsh redox potential, a proxy for biogeochemical state, through wavelet analyses and information theory using data from seven marshes. The results point to terrestrial groundwater level as a dominant control on redox variability across all sites. Because redox is a key driver of biogeochemical processes, and specifically oxidation of organic matter that sequesters carbon and maintains marsh elevation, these terrestrial influences are critical to understanding marsh function and evolution. The newly identified links between onshore groundwater levels and marsh redox conditions shift the traditional paradigm and suggest that terrestrial hydrology is a primary control on salt marsh carbon sequestration potential and resilience.

The role of climate and population change in global flood exposure and vulnerability,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56654-8,2025-02-03,Flooding is a pervasive natural hazard with wide-ranging impacts on society. Using a high-resolution global flood model considering coastal, fluvial, and pluvial hazards, we clarify the role of climate effects versus population growth effects in changing flood exposure. Between 2020 and 2100, the population likely exposed to 1% annual risk (100-year) flood hazard will increase from 1.6 to 1.9 billion people. Of this change from the 2020 exposure, we attribute 21.1% to climate change, 76.8% to population change, and 2.1% to both climate and population change. The largest driver of uncertainty in exposure is population change, while climate change remains a smaller but still important driver. The global increase in exposure between 2020 and 2100 is primarily driven by low-GDP regions, and by 2100 the lowest GDP areas will make up 63% of the exposure both overall and in urban areas. Urban areas are especially vulnerable in nearly all global regions, and urban areas sensitive to extreme events are expected to see a 33% increase in population exposure. This study highlights the vast inequities in flood exposure, and future work should direct resources and strategies toward sustainable risk mitigation in these areas.

Recent centennial drought on the Tibetan Plateau is outstanding within the past 3500 years,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56687-z,2025-02-03,Given growing concerns about global climate change, it is critical to understand both historical and current shifts in the hydroclimate, particularly in regions critically entwined with global circulation. The Tibetan Plateau, the Earth’s largest and highest plateau, is a nexus for global atmospheric processes, significantly influencing East Asian hydroclimate dynamics through the synergy of the Asian Monsoon and the Westerlies. Yet, understanding historical and recent hydroclimate fluctuations and their wide-ranging ecological and societal consequences remains challenging due to short instrumental observations and partly ambiguous proxy reconstructions. Here, we present a precisely-dated 3476-year precipitation reconstruction derived from tree-ring δ<sup>18</sup>O data on the Tibetan Plateau, representing one of the few multi-millennia-long annually-resolved terrestrial δ<sup>18</sup>O records to date. Our findings reveal that the 20<sup>th</sup> century drought extremes are severe within the past three millennia, and likely linked to the weakening of both the Asian Monsoon and Westerlies due to anthropogenic aerosol emissions.

Australian water quality trends over two decades show deterioration in the Great Barrier Reef region and recovery in the Murray-Darling Basin,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02044-3,2025-01-29,Understanding river water quality trajectories and drivers is crucial for effective environmental management. Here we present a comprehensive nation-wide water quality trend assessment across Australia with 287 catchments from 2000 to 2019. About half of the catchments show significant trends in the flow-normalised concentration for each parameter analysed. Most of these significant trends are due to changes in concentration-flow relationships rather than long-term trends in flow. Two of Australia’s major river basins show opposing regional patterns in their significant trends. The North East Coast, which largely flows into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, has increasing phosphorus and sediments. This potentially reflects lagged effects of increasing land clearing and fertilisation since 1960s, while land improvement in the region has not yet demonstrated improvement on water quality. The Murray-Darling Basin has decreasing salinity, phosphorus, and sediment, likely driven by effects of a region-scale salinity management interventions and a prolonged drought on catchment processes.

Human-induced water loss potentially threatens sustainable development of sandy regions in China,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02046-1,2025-01-30,Water is indispensable for sustainable socioeconomic development, especially in China’s sandy regions. Despite existing studies in sandy regions, the drivers of changes in total water storage and their potential impacts remain inadequately understood. Here we found a 55.97 billion m³ net loss in total water storage from 2002 to 2023 by integrating multiple datasets. Water loss was primarily attributed to increased farmland irrigation (49.56 billion m³) and ecological restoration (37.04 billion m³). In the coming 40 years, water supply capacity will decrease by up to 6.54% and 19.07% under low and high emission scenarios, respectively, requiring reductions in human water consumption of 60% to 135%. This depletion potentially threatens both regional sustainability and national ecological security. This study calls for urgent scientific regulations on water resources, including strict control of local consumption and enhancement of supply capacity.

Global water gaps under future warming levels,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56517-2,2025-01-30,Understanding the impacts of climate change on water resources is crucial for developing effective adaptation strategies. We quantify “water gaps”, or unsustainable water use – the shortfall where water demand exceeds supply, resulting in scarcity. We quantify baseline and future water gaps using a multi-model analysis that incorporates two plausible future warming scenarios. The baseline global water gap stands at 457.9 km<sup>3</sup>/yr, with projections indicating an increase of 26.5 km<sup>3</sup>/yr (+5.8%) and 67.4 km<sup>3</sup>/yr (+14.7%) under 1.5 °C and 3 °C warming scenarios, respectively. These projections highlight the uneven impact of warming levels on water gaps, emphasizing the need for continued climate change mitigation to alleviate stress on water resources. Our results also underscore the unequal adaptation needs across countries and basins, influenced by varying warming scenarios, with important regional differences and model variability complicating future projections. Robust water management strategies are needed to tackle the escalating water scarcity caused by global warming.

Bias-corrected high-resolution temperature and precipitation projections for Canada,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04396-z,2025-02-01,High-resolution precipitation and temperature projections are indispensable for informed decision-making, risk assessment, and planning. Here, we have developed an extensive database (SPQM-CMIP6-CAN) of high-resolution (0.1°) precipitation and temperature projections extending till 2100 at a daily scale for Canada. We employed a novel Semi-Parametric Quantile Mapping (SPQM) methodology to bias-correct the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase-6 (CMIP6) projections for four Shared Socio-economic Pathways. SPQM is simple, yet robust, in reproducing the observed marginal properties, trends, and variability according to future scenarios, while maintaining a smooth transition from observations to projected simulations. The SPQM-CMIP6-CAN database encompasses 693 simulations derived from 34 diverse climate models for precipitation. Similarly, for temperature projections, our database comprises 581 simulations from 27 climate models. These projections are valuable for hydrological, environmental, and ecological studies, offering a comprehensive resource for analyses within these domains. Furthermore, these projections serve as a vital tool for the quantification of uncertainties arising from climate models, their variant configurations, and future scenarios.

The hidden influence of terrestrial groundwater on salt marsh function and resilience,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00384-6,2025-02-03,Salt marshes are hotspots of nutrient processing and carbon sequestration. So far, studies addressing spatiotemporal variability in and drivers of salt marsh biogeochemical function, carbon storage and resilience have focused on ocean-driven surface hydrologic influences, neglecting effects of terrestrial hydrology through subsurface connections. Here we evaluate drivers of salt marsh redox potential, a proxy for biogeochemical state, through wavelet analyses and information theory using data from seven marshes. The results point to terrestrial groundwater level as a dominant control on redox variability across all sites. Because redox is a key driver of biogeochemical processes, and specifically oxidation of organic matter that sequesters carbon and maintains marsh elevation, these terrestrial influences are critical to understanding marsh function and evolution. The newly identified links between onshore groundwater levels and marsh redox conditions shift the traditional paradigm and suggest that terrestrial hydrology is a primary control on salt marsh carbon sequestration potential and resilience.

The role of climate and population change in global flood exposure and vulnerability,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56654-8,2025-02-03,Flooding is a pervasive natural hazard with wide-ranging impacts on society. Using a high-resolution global flood model considering coastal, fluvial, and pluvial hazards, we clarify the role of climate effects versus population growth effects in changing flood exposure. Between 2020 and 2100, the population likely exposed to 1% annual risk (100-year) flood hazard will increase from 1.6 to 1.9 billion people. Of this change from the 2020 exposure, we attribute 21.1% to climate change, 76.8% to population change, and 2.1% to both climate and population change. The largest driver of uncertainty in exposure is population change, while climate change remains a smaller but still important driver. The global increase in exposure between 2020 and 2100 is primarily driven by low-GDP regions, and by 2100 the lowest GDP areas will make up 63% of the exposure both overall and in urban areas. Urban areas are especially vulnerable in nearly all global regions, and urban areas sensitive to extreme events are expected to see a 33% increase in population exposure. This study highlights the vast inequities in flood exposure, and future work should direct resources and strategies toward sustainable risk mitigation in these areas.

Recent centennial drought on the Tibetan Plateau is outstanding within the past 3500 years,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56687-z,2025-02-03,Given growing concerns about global climate change, it is critical to understand both historical and current shifts in the hydroclimate, particularly in regions critically entwined with global circulation. The Tibetan Plateau, the Earth’s largest and highest plateau, is a nexus for global atmospheric processes, significantly influencing East Asian hydroclimate dynamics through the synergy of the Asian Monsoon and the Westerlies. Yet, understanding historical and recent hydroclimate fluctuations and their wide-ranging ecological and societal consequences remains challenging due to short instrumental observations and partly ambiguous proxy reconstructions. Here, we present a precisely-dated 3476-year precipitation reconstruction derived from tree-ring δ<sup>18</sup>O data on the Tibetan Plateau, representing one of the few multi-millennia-long annually-resolved terrestrial δ<sup>18</sup>O records to date. Our findings reveal that the 20<sup>th</sup> century drought extremes are severe within the past three millennia, and likely linked to the weakening of both the Asian Monsoon and Westerlies due to anthropogenic aerosol emissions. Additionally, our analyses identified three distinct stages (110 BC–AD 280, AD 330–770 and AD 950–1300) characterized by shifts toward arid hydroclimate conditions, corresponding to significant social unrest and dynasty collapses, which underscores the potential societal impacts of severe hydroclimatic shifts.

In-soil and above ground microclimate and ET data are presented on a 15-minute interval as are weather data for all days of the year. Data analysis determined ET, precipitation, irrigation, and dew and frost accumulation on a 15-minute basis from lysimeter mass data. Soil water content data from calibrated neutron probe readings is presented on a periodic basis. Crop planting, harvest, fertilization, pest control, and other agronomic information are presented in agronomic calendars by day of year. Crop growth data are presented on a periodic basis throughout the growing season, as are final crop biomass and yield data.

Hyper-resolution naturalized streamflow data for Geum River in South Korea (1951–2020),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04486-y,2025-02-04,Long-term streamflow data at a hyper-resolution (less than 1 km) is essential for hydroclimatic extreme and ecological assessment, which is not available over a river basin where rapid socioeconomic growth have been experienced. Here, we use the Variable Infiltration Capacity-River Routing Model (VIC-RRM) to reconstruct naturalized daily streamflow at 90–meter resolution for the Geum River, one of South Korea’s major rivers, over 1951–2020. VIC-RRM demonstrates high temporal consistency with a correlation coefficient exceeding 0.6 for observed streamflow seasonality at over 60% of the 90 gauge stations along the Geum River. However, 36% of the stations show low modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (0.2–0.4), primarily due to uncertainties in runoff data and human disturbance impacts like irrigation and reservoir storage. Our simulated naturalized data reveal decadal variability in the 1990s and an increase in day-to-day variability of the Geum River in the 2010s compared to those in the 1970s. This dataset provides physically consistent naturalized streamflow data for reference data to evaluate climate change-driven changes in streamflow for the Geum River.

Yet despite the key role that croplands play in global land use and Earth systems, there remains little understanding of how spatial patterns of global crop cultivation have recently evolved and which crops have contributed most to these changes. Here we construct a new data library of subnational crop-specific irrigated and rainfed harvested area statistics and combine it with global gridded land cover products to develop a global gridded (5-arcminute) irrigated and rainfed cropped area (MIRCA-OS) dataset for the years 2000 to 2015 for 23 crop classes. These global data products support critical insights into the spatially detailed patterns of irrigated and rainfed cropland change since the start of the century and provide an improved foundation for a wide array of global assessments spanning agriculture, water resource management, land use change, climate impact, and sustainable development.

To this end, an enhanced rainfall-induced landslide catalogue, e-ITALICA, is presented here. e-ITALICA contains spatial and temporal information on 6312 rainfall-induced landslides that occurred in Italy between 1996 and 2021 (already listed in the previous ITALICA catalogue published in 2023), with the addition of their rainfall triggering conditions in terms of rainfall duration <i>D</i> (h) and cumulative event rainfall <i>E</i> (mm). The triggering conditions are calculated using hourly rainfall measurements from 4033 rain gauges and applying a rigorous and reproducible method. In addition, topographic and land cover information is also provided. e-ITALICA can be used to analyse rainfall conditions capable of triggering landslides, to calibrate and validate physically based landslide prediction models, and to define empirical rainfall thresholds from local to national scales in Italy, thus contributing to landslide risk reduction.

The land–ocean Arctic carbon cycle,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-024-00627-w,2025-02-06,Anthropogenic climate warming is amplified in the Arctic, impacting the Arctic carbon cycle and its role in regulating climate and global biogeochemical cycles. In this Review, we provide a quantitative and comprehensive overview of the present-day Arctic carbon cycle across the land–ocean continuum. Terrestrial soil stocks total 877 ± 16 Pg C, with upper marine sediments containing 82 ± 35 Pg C. Overall, the integrated Arctic system is a carbon sink, driven by oceanic uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> (127 ± 36 Tg C year<sup>−1</sup>) and organic carbon burial in shelf sea sediments (112 ± 41 Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>). Terrestrial systems, including inland waters and disturbance, are a net source of CH<sub>4</sub> (38 (21, 53) Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>) and CO<sub>2</sub> (12 (–606, 661) Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>). The Arctic carbon sink will likely weaken under continued warming, owing to factors such as increased coastal erosion, outgassing of riverine organic carbon and enhanced nearshore carbon turnover lowering shelf sediment burial. Arctic greening and increases in terrestrial carbon sinks will be substantially offset by increases in soil respiration, disturbance from extreme events and enhanced emissions from inland waters. Future research should prioritize enhanced coverage of small catchments and nearshore regions, and inclusion of non-linear responses in biogeochemical models.

However, 36% of the stations show low modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (0.2–0.4), primarily due to uncertainties in runoff data and human disturbance impacts like irrigation and reservoir storage. Our simulated naturalized data reveal decadal variability in the 1990s and an increase in day-to-day variability of the Geum River in the 2010s compared to those in the 1970s. This dataset provides physically consistent naturalized streamflow data for reference data to evaluate climate change-driven changes in streamflow for the Geum River.

A global open-source dataset of monthly irrigated and rainfed cropped areas (MIRCA-OS) for the 21st century,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-04313-w,2025-02-04,Crop production is among the most extensive human activities on the planet – with critical importance for global food security, land use, environmental burden, and climate. Yet despite the key role that croplands play in global land use and Earth systems, there remains little understanding of how spatial patterns of global crop cultivation have recently evolved and which crops have contributed most to these changes. Here we construct a new data library of subnational crop-specific irrigated and rainfed harvested area statistics and combine it with global gridded land cover products to develop a global gridded (5-arcminute) irrigated and rainfed cropped area (MIRCA-OS) dataset for the years 2000 to 2015 for 23 crop classes. These global data products support critical insights into the spatially detailed patterns of irrigated and rainfed cropland change since the start of the century and provide an improved foundation for a wide array of global assessments spanning agriculture, water resource management, land use change, climate impact, and sustainable development.

An enhanced rainfall-induced landslide catalogue in Italy,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04551-6,2025-02-05,With the increasing use of data-driven landslide prediction models also based on artificial intelligence, the availability of accurate information on the occurrence of landslides and the rigorous reconstruction of their triggering rainfall conditions are crucial. To this end, an enhanced rainfall-induced landslide catalogue, e-ITALICA, is presented here. e-ITALICA contains spatial and temporal information on 6312 rainfall-induced landslides that occurred in Italy between 1996 and 2021 (already listed in the previous ITALICA catalogue published in 2023), with the addition of their rainfall triggering conditions in terms of rainfall duration <i>D</i> (h) and cumulative event rainfall <i>E</i> (mm). The triggering conditions are calculated using hourly rainfall measurements from 4033 rain gauges and applying a rigorous and reproducible method. In addition, topographic and land cover information is also provided. e-ITALICA can be used to analyse rainfall conditions capable of triggering landslides, to calibrate and validate physically based landslide prediction models, and to define empirical rainfall thresholds from local to national scales in Italy, thus contributing to landslide risk reduction.

The land–ocean Arctic carbon cycle,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-024-00627-w,2025-02-06,Anthropogenic climate warming is amplified in the Arctic, impacting the Arctic carbon cycle and its role in regulating climate and global biogeochemical cycles. In this Review, we provide a quantitative and comprehensive overview of the present-day Arctic carbon cycle across the land–ocean continuum. Terrestrial soil stocks total 877 ± 16 Pg C, with upper marine sediments containing 82 ± 35 Pg C. Overall, the integrated Arctic system is a carbon sink, driven by oceanic uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> (127 ± 36 Tg C year<sup>−1</sup>) and organic carbon burial in shelf sea sediments (112 ± 41 Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>). Terrestrial systems, including inland waters and disturbance, are a net source of CH<sub>4</sub> (38 (21, 53) Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>) and CO<sub>2</sub> (12 (–606, 661) Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>). The Arctic carbon sink will likely weaken under continued warming, owing to factors such as increased coastal erosion, outgassing of riverine organic carbon and enhanced nearshore carbon turnover lowering shelf sediment burial. Arctic greening and increases in terrestrial carbon sinks will be substantially offset by increases in soil respiration, disturbance from extreme events and enhanced emissions from inland waters. Future research should prioritize enhanced coverage of small catchments and nearshore regions, and inclusion of non-linear responses in biogeochemical models.

Not as random: the stable dynamics controlling shallow convective clouds,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-025-00924-1,2025-02-07,Shallow, sparse, non-precipitating convective clouds forming over the ocean are considered among the least organized cloud fields. The formation mechanism of these clouds is associated with random, local perturbations that create buoyant parcels. Their sparseness suggests no or very weak interactions between clouds. Here, we show that such clouds form within a well-organized, stable, dense mesh of convective cells that operate continuously, independent of the presence of visible clouds.npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
Rising groundwater table due to restoration projects amplifies earthquake induced liquefaction risk in Beijing,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56525-2,2025-02-08,Groundwater restoration is increasingly common to mitigate groundwater overexploitation, which proves effective in resolving urban water scarcity and regional unsustainable development. China’s South-to-North Water Diversion Project is one of the largest water transfer projects to restore groundwater and resolve water shortage in Beijing. However, how the rapidly restored groundwater of this magnitude changes regional seismic stability is largely unknown. Here, we explore the relation between elevated groundwater table and seismic ground liquefaction based on the case of Beijing under the impact of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. We collect groundwater table depth records and use them to drive three-dimensional geotechnical models that generate ground liquefaction hazard maps. We find a remarkable increase in coverage and severity of liquefaction due to groundwater table rise. Infrastructures built during the rapid urbanization process are often under low groundwater table and thus illy prepared for this increased seismic risk. These findings highlight the necessity to consider the seismic consequence of large-scale groundwater restoration projects.,Nature Communications
Wildfires mediate carbon transfer from land to lakes across boreal and temperate regions,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02070-1,2025-02-08,Wildfires can disrupt carbon transport from land to water, but how lake carbon cycling responds to fires remains unclear. Here, we analyzed the concentration and dominance of the main carbon forms in total carbon pools in 54 lakes (34 burned, 20 control) across 3 regions of Quebec, Canada and Minnesota, USA from recent wildfires ( &lt; 1 – 3 years). Lakes in burned watersheds had up to double the dissolved organic carbon concentrations of control lakes, and the fire effect was most apparent when accounting for climate and landscape drivers (e.g., catchment to lake area ratio) of lake carbon cycling. The greater quantity and dominance of dissolved organic carbon in burned lakes over other carbon forms with different turnover rates and fates suggest a potential fire-mediated carbon export up to several years post fire with a yet undetermined fate in northern forested watersheds and with important implications for regional to global carbon budgets.,Communications Earth & Environment
An annotated satellite imagery dataset for automated river barrier object detection,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04590-z,2025-02-10,Millions of river barriers have been constructed worldwide for flood control, hydropower generation, and agricultural irrigation. The lack of comprehensive records on river barriers’ locations and types, particularly small barriers including weirs, limits our ability to assess their societal and environmental impacts. Integrating satellite imagery with object detection algorithms holds promise for the automatic identification of river barriers on a global scale. However, achieving this objective requires high-quality image datasets for algorithm training and testing. Hence, this study presents a large-scale dataset named the River Barrier Object Detection (RBOD). It comprises 4,872 high-resolution satellite images and 11,741 meticulously annotated oriented bounding boxes (OBBs), encompassing five classes of river barriers. The effectiveness of the RBOD dataset was validated using five typical object detection algorithms, which provide performance benchmarks for future applications. To the best of our knowledge, RBOD is the first publicly available dataset for river barrier object detection, providing a valuable resource for the understanding and management of river barriers.,Scientific Data
